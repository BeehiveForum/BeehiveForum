To include the TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor download the source from:
  http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/ (tested with v1.43)

Within the compressed source there should be a directory:
  tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/
Simply copy everything from that tiny_mce directory into the directory this readme is in. 
If your forum is located at http://www.yourserver.com/forum/ then if you have copied the files 
correctly there will exist a file: http://www.yourserver.com/forum/tiny_mce/tiny_mce.js

There is a Beehive plugin for TinyMCE which should have already been in your forum's 
tiny_mce directory, under the subdirectory plugins/beehive. If this is not the case copy the
directory tiny_mce/plugins/beehive from a fresh download of Beehive to your forum.
