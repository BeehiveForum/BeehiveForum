Beehive Forum Release Notes

What's new in 0.5 ("TBD", released 5th Never)
=================

- Notes
        - Beehive Forum 0.5 corrected a very large scale problem with
	  stripslashes which means that content created with prior
	  versions may be subject to erranous display once you
	  upgrade to 0.5.

- Brand new features

        - Multiple Forum support. Yes, finally you can run more than one
          forum on your web space using a single Beehive installation, under
	  a 'My Forums' linking system.
	- Forums can be open/closed/restricted/passworded.
	- Install/upgrade script simplifies installation process.
	- Comprehensive user permissions - users can be given/denied access
	  to post/read/moderate etc. in specific folders, as well as having 
	  HTML/sig privileges given/denied.
	- As well as per-folder moderators, a user can be assigned as a 
	  'Global moderator', who can moderate in all folders.
	- User groups can be created to help moderation of large forums.
	- New 'Forum Links' drop-down in the top frame allows for linking
	  other Beehive forums and sites easily.
        - New 'My Controls' replaces the old preferences and profile
          sections, incorporating them into a single location.
        - Emoticons. Really fancy emoticons. With per-user options to display
	  any of several graphical sets, or plain-text, or nothing at all.
	- Emoticon preview pane on post page for quick reference.
        - Users can now perform basic moderation duties on their own
          posts on the new 'Thread Options' page, including changing the thread 
	  title and moving the thread to different folders. Admins can prevent 
	  this functionality by 'edit locking' the thread to prevent it from 
	  being changed.
	- Users can access 'Thread Options' by clicking the icon to the left
	  of every thread title in the thread list frame. From here a thread can
	  be ignored without ever reading it.
	- Posts can now be marked as unread, for later reading.
	- New 'Reply as PM' link on every post will quickly create a new PM
	  addressed to the post author, with the thread title as the subject.
	- Number of PMs per user can be restricted by the admin.
	- PM auto-pruning - messages not in the 'saved' folder can be 
	  automatically deleted after a certain time has passed.
	- Option to reply a PM with the in-reply-to PM's text quoted.
        - New user option to change all images embedded into a post by users
          (inc. signature images) into clickable links.
	- 'Reply to all' allows a user to reply to an entire thread instead of
	  a specific post.
	- New tabular polls to compare votes from different poll groups.
	- Quick search.
	- Per-user word filter.
	- Beautifier (www.beautifier.org) integration with BH <code> tag.
	- <spoiler> tag to hide text which may otherwise spoil that movie
	  you're planning on seeing tonight's killer plot twist. <spoiler>He
	  was dead all along!!</spoiler>
	- <noemots> tag to prevent anything within it from being converted to
	  an emoticon.
	- New post page preferences which allow you to toggle the HTML toolbar,
	  the emoticons preview pane and the signature textfield. You can also
	  choose an HTML mode by default; you can choose to enable/disable
	  emoticons in your messages by default and so on.
	- Guest account no longer requires cookies, so that search engines can
	  spider Beehive forums. A robots.txt file is also included to help
	  search engines spider the right content.
	- A user can now set their default start page to be the thread list in
	  the left frame, and the forum start page in the right frame.
	- New thread_rss.php allows recent Beehive threads to be loaded into an
	  RSS reader.
	- Previous/next post navigation arrows.
	- 'Unread Today' threadlist filter option.
	- Admin tools to delete all a user's posts in a thread, or throughout the
	  whole forum.
	- Admin option to delete an entire thread.
	- 'Ignore Completely' option allows you to ignore all posts to/from a user
	  as well as any threads they create.

- Enhanced old features

        - HTML toolbar is now present for post creation; post editing; poll
	  creation; signature editing; PM creation; PM editing; start page
	  editing. Can't get enough of that HTML toolbar.
	- Slicker HTML integration - <quote>/<code>/<spoiler> tags won't show
	  their innards, for example.
	- Better editing page. No longer will you have to toggle between a 
	  plain-text/HTML version of your post - BH will automatically 
	  approximoguesstimate what settings you originally posted your message
	  with.
	- Polls can now be 'soft-edited' - minor edits which won't reset the
	  votes.
	- Poll options can either be displayed as radio buttons (as before) or
	  as a drop-down list.
        - Improved word filter that allows you to find and replace rather than 
          obscure the filtered words with asterix.
        - Word filter can now be disable without having to clear the filter 
          list of the current entries. Useful if browsing from different places 
          such as home and work.
        - Many pages have had their output tweaked so they fit in with the 
          overall style of beehive.
        - Attachments now support the uploading of multiple files at the same 
          time. Useful for dial-up users who want to attach multiple files 
          without having to do each file in turn.
        - The forum owner can now choose to have deleted attachments still 
          show (with the link removed) in posts.
        - Alternative attachment method which allows Beehive to make use of the 
          old 0.3 and older attachment retrieval method for servers that can't 
          handle the newer method.
        - The search page has been remade with a better design and better 
	  functionality.
	- 'Page [1] 2 3 ...' on various pages rewritten a bit posher.

- Fixes
        - Lots and lots!

What's new in 0.3.1 ("Beemused", released 3rd September 2003)
===================

- New features / Enhancements
        - There are no new features or enhancements in this release.
          This release is primarily intended to fix some problems that
          exist in MySQL 4.0.13 and higher. Don't worry 0.4 will be
          coming soon!

- Fixes
        - Users lost access to restricted folders if they ignored them
        - Queen could loose her 'Queen' Status and be demoted to a
          soldier if he/she changed her own permissions through the
          Admin Users interface.
        - It was not possible to delete Profile Items and when deleting
          a Profile Section the wrong one was deleted.
        - Threads would not be visible at all regardless of folder
          interest settings under MySQL 4.0.13 and later
        - Recent discussions list on Start Page would appear empty
          under MySQL 4.0.13.

What's new in 0.3 ("A little Beehind", released 11th February 2003)
=================

- Brand new features
        - All output is now optionally gzip encoded to save bandwidth.
        - The styles system has changed a bit - the majority of the stylesheet
          is now static, which saves even more bandwidth.
        - You can modify the start page directly from the admin interface.
        - As well as ignoring a user, you can make them your "Friend", and
          filter the thread list to only show discussions started by Friends if
          you want.
        - New poll system, with up to 20 options per poll.
        - There's a new frame-less light HTML "diet" version of the forum - now
          you can browse and post from a PDA and some mobile phones.
        - A links section that allows your users to create a database of useful
          links.
        - You can see a list of possible aliases for any user (people who have
          logged in from the same IP address before)
        - Banning a user by IP address is now possible.
        - Option to delete all of a user's posts in the admin interface.
        - You can now ignore entire folders.

- Enhanced old features
        - Guest access is now optional.
        - Other changes to polls, such as the ability to post an explanatory
          message at the same time as you post the poll.
        - Various new UI stuff - friend / attachment icons in the thread list,
          link back to the voting form in a poll thread, etc.
        - Polls are now slightly more anonymous (at least, it's not trivial for
          someone with database access to see how you voted, but neither is it
          secure).
        - Users can choose to be directed straight to the forum (bypassing the
          start page) when logging in.
        - The time a user last logged on and the total number of posts they have
          made on the forum are displayed in their profile.
        - You can now ignore only someone's signature, or globally ignore all
          signatures if you want.
        - Mark as Read has more options (all discussions, visible discussions,
          next 50 discussions)

- Fixes
        - We've given the code a spring clean - hopefully there are now no PHP
          errors/warnings/notices at all.
        - Various fixes to make things work properly with Microsoft-IIS.
        - Some fixes to properly support PHP 4.3.x.
        - Some of the database stuff (mainly thread list queries) has been
          optimised for efficiency.
        - Database errors are now caught in a nice way.
        - Some session handling improvements

What's new in 0.2 ("Let It Bee", released 12th September 2002)
=================

- User Selectable Styles: Forum members can now select from a number of styles
to change the appearance of the forum. Pretty much everything can be styled, by
editing the CSS files and altering the images.

- Polls: Polls are now enabled. They let people vote, and stuff.

- Attachments: Forum owners can optionally enable the attachments feature,
allowing members to upload files to the forum server. Space available per member
can be limited.

- Forgot password: Muppets who forget their passwords can now get an e-mail to
the address they entered, with a link where they can reset the password.

- Guest access: Casual browsers can access forums as guests, but can not post.

- Lots of little things: Little enhancements here and there that just generally
make things nicer. Like friend icons in the message view, and multiple logins
being saveable.

- Discontinued undocumented features: Most of the undocumented features from 0.1
have been removed, such as the undocumented feature where fix_html would
occasionally loop until PHP timed out, and the famous "time-travelling"
undocumented feature where post's creation times were updated when they were
read by the user they were addressed to.

- New undocumented features: It is possible that the addition of the new 
documented features has resulted in the accidental addition of new undocumented
features. If you believe you have found an undocumented feature, please let us
know in the test forum at http://beehiveforum.net/forum

- \o/ Domain name \o/: We got the domain name registered, so you can now use
http://beehiveforum.net for all your Beehive URL needs. It's still hosted on
SourceForge (http://sf.net), lovely people that they are.
