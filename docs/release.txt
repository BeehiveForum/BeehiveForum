Beehive Forum Release Notes

What's new in 0.4 (TBD, released ??th November 2003)
=================

- Brand new features
        - Personal Messages allow users to keep more private matters out of
	  view from the rest of the forum members.
	- I18N multiple language support is now included with Beehive which
	  allows Beehive to be viewed in a variety of languages. See readme.txt
	  for more information.
	- New Post and Edit pages including intelligent HTML toolbar which
	  allows for quick and easy creation of HTML posts without having
	  to worry about paragraphs and other such things.
	- Configurable Profile options allow you to specify some basic options
	  for the profile page including the type of input field (text, radio
	  buttons, dropdown, etc)
	- Groupable poll options allow users to create polls with different
	  related options, so you can now easily find out who likes fried
	  eggs and whether or not they prefer them sunny side up or not.
	- Public Ballot polls allow the creation of a poll which can be used
	  to display the option each user selects under the option name in
	  the extended results display. When used in conjunction with the
	  Public Ballot option the results can also be sorted by
	  user so you can instantly see which options a user voted for.
	- Stats display shows some basic stats such as the active users, the
	  maximum number of users ever active, number of total posts and
	  threads made and other such delights.

- Fixes
        - High Interest and Unread High Interest now work properly under
	  MySQL 4.0.13 and above.
	- Some fixes to make Beehive more palatable with IIS.

What's new in 0.3.1 ("Beemused", released 3rd September 2003)
===================

- New features / Enhancements
        - There are no new features or enhancements in this release.
          This release is primarily intended to fix some problems that
          exist in MySQL 4.0.13 and higher. Don't worry 0.4 will be
          coming soon!

- Fixes
        - Users lost access to restricted folders if they ignored them
        - Queen could loose her 'Queen' Status and be demoted to a
          soldier if he/she changed her own permissions through the
          Admin Users interface.
        - It was not possible to delete Profile Items and when deleting
          a Profile Section the wrong one was deleted.
        - Threads would not be visible at all regardless of folder
          interest settings under MySQL 4.0.13 and later
        - Recent discussions list on Start Page would appear empty
          under MySQL 4.0.13.

What's new in 0.3 ("A little Beehind", released 11th February 2003)
=================

- Brand new features
        - All output is now optionally gzip encoded to save bandwidth.
        - The styles system has changed a bit - the majority of the stylesheet
          is now static, which saves even more bandwidth.
        - You can modify the start page directly from the admin interface.
        - As well as ignoring a user, you can make them your "Friend", and
          filter the thread list to only show discusisons started by Friends if
          you want.
        - New poll system, with up to 20 options per poll.
        - There's a new frameless light HTML "diet" version of the forum - now
          you can browse and post from a PDA and some mobile phones.
        - A links section that allows your users to create a database of useful
          links.
        - You can see a list of possible aliases for any user (people who have
          logged in from the same IP address before)
        - Banning a user by IP address is now possible.
        - Option to delete all of a user's posts in the admin interface.
        - You can now ignore entire folders.

- Enhanced old features
        - Guest access is now optional.
        - Other changes to polls, such as the ability to post an explanatory
          message at the same time as you post the poll.
        - Various new UI stuff - friend / attachment icons in the thread list,
          link back to the voting form in a poll thread, etc.
        - Polls are now slightly more anonymous (at least, it's not trivial for
          someone with database access to see how you voted, but neither is it
          secure).
        - Users can choose to be directed straight to the forum (bypassing the
          start page) when logging in.
        - The time a user last logged on and the total number of posts they have
          made on the forum are displayed in their profile.
        - You can now ignore only someone's signature, or globally ignore all
          signatures if you want.
        - Mark as Read has more options (all discussions, visible discussions,
          next 50 discussions)

- Fixes
        - We've given the code a spring clean - hopefully there are now no PHP
          errors/warnings/notices at all.
        - Various fixes to make things work properly with Microsoft-IIS.
        - Some fixes to properly support PHP 4.3.x.
        - Some of the database stuff (mainly thread list queries) has been
          optimised for efficiency.
        - Database errors are now caught in a nice way.
        - Some session handling improvements

What's new in 0.2 ("Let It Bee", released 12th September 2002)
=================

- User Selectable Styles: Forum members can now select from a number of styles
to change the appearance of the forum. Pretty much everything can be styled, by
editing the CSS files and altering the images.

- Polls: Polls are now enabled. They let people vote, and stuff.

- Attachments: Forum owners can optionally enable the attachments feature,
allowing members to upload files to the forum server. Space available per member
can be limited.

- Forgot password: Muppets who forget their passwords can now get an e-mail to
the address they entered, with a link where they can reset the password.

- Guest access: Casual browsers can access forums as guests, but can not post.

- Lots of little things: Little enhancements here and there that just generally
make things nicer. Like friend icons in the message view, and multiple logins
being saveable.

- Discontinued undocumented features: Most of the undocumented features from 0.1
have been removed, such as the undocumented feature where fix_html would
occasionally loop until PHP timed out, and the famous "time-travelling"
undocumented feature where post's creation times were updated when they were
read by the user they were addressed to.

- New undocumented features: It is possible that the addition of the new 
documented features has resulted in the accidental addition of new undocumented
features. If you believe you have found an undocumented feature, please let us
know in the test forum at http://beehiveforum.net/forum

- \o/ Domain name \o/: We got the domain name registered, so you can now use
http://beehiveforum.net for all your Beehive URL needs. It's still hosted on
SourceForge (http://sf.net), lovely people that they are.
