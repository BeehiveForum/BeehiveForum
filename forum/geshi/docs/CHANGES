              CHANGES - Changelog for GeSHi (geshi.php only)

Changes to the code are listed under the version they occured in, with who suggested
it by each one (if there's nobody listed as suggesting it I dreamed it up :)). Users
who suggested an idea often also provided the code that was used as a basis for the
changes - thanks to all who suggested these ideas and gave me the code to show me how!

Language files listed under each version were made by the author beside them, and then
modified by me for consistency/bug fixing.

Please send any bug reports to nigel@geshi.org, or use the bug report tracker
at sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=114997&atid=670231)

     method

  -  Advanced regular expression handling
  -  Bug fixes to lexic_permission handling

Version 1.0.1
  -  Added methods set_symbols_style() and set_symbols_highlighting(). These should be used
     instead of set_brackets_style and set_brackets_highlighting respectively.
  -  Added a new field - language_path - that can be set either when the constructor is
     called, or by the new method set_language_path(), that specifies a path to the directory
     containing the language files (bug reported by bbspliff)
  -  Added a new method set_case_keywords(), that allows the auto-casing feature to be
     changed on the fly instead of simply being specified in the language file
  -  If there is an error the source that is outputted is now handled much better
  -  Lines are broken in the source only by \n now, not by \r\n (to save on output source)
  -  Indentation moved into its own method
  -  Method header() modified to allow the user to choose whether the code is surrounded in
     a <div> or a <pre> (see documentation for benefits of both). Method footer() likewise
     modified.
  -  Method get_stylesheet() modified so that a smaller comment is outputted in economy mode,
     and bugs with when line number classes are outputted in economy mode have been fixed
  -  Bug where spans had two quotes at the end of the attributes fixed (ie. <span style=".."">)
  -  Added language files:
     * Ada (Tux)
     * Apache log file (Tux)
     * ASM (Tux)
     * NSIS (Tux)
     * Pascal (Tux)
