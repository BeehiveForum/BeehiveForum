      to the main styles directory.

      silkicon set.
    - New logon page allows the browser to save user
      credentials and helps cut down on the number of

      now pin your Beehive Forum to your Windows Superbar
      and make use of quick shortcuts to various sections
      including Messages, PM Inbox and Admin Tools.
    - Lots and lots of bugs fixed!
    - For comprehensive list of changes please see the change log.

      caching of the page output for the most frequently
      visited pages on your forum including thread list,
      message pane and the start pages. If you encounter

             mature or restricted.
    - Added: Bans can now be set to expire on a set date.
    - Fixed: Deleting a user was physically deleting a user's
             posts from the database instead of NULL-ing the
             content resulting in errors when accesing affected
             threads.

- Notes

    - 0.7.1 replaces the original 0.7 release of 1st October.
      The database schema for 0.7.1 is identical to 0.7. To
      upgrade from 0.7 to 0.7.1 simply extract the archive
      over your existing installation and delete the installer
      files. Upgrades from 0.6.x to 0.7.1 will still require
      running the installer as normal.
    - BeehiveForum 0.7 introduces a new thread unread cut-off
      that helps to increase performance by storing unread
      thread data for a limited time rather than in previous
      builds where it was stored indefinitely. You can set up
      the thread unread cut-off in the Global Forum Settings
      portion of your Beehive Forum installation but pruning
      of the USER\_THREAD tables must be performed by hand.

             delete.php, create\_poll.php and admin\_post\_approve.php

             error message when performing upgrade from 0.6.x.
    - Fixed: Errors in English UK and English US language files.
    - Fixed: Search was sometimes showing no thread titles in
             results.
    - Fixed: Extra query in thread\_delete which was cleaning the
             USER\_THREAD table twice.
    - Fixed: Fixed special characters not being encoded
             correctly in RSS feed.
    - Added: More intuitive controls for moving folders, forum
             links and profile sections and items.

## What's new in 0.7 (Released 1st October 2006)

      builds where it was stored indefinitely. You can set up
      the thread unread cut-off in the Global Forum Settings
      portion of your Beehive Forum installation but pruning
      of the USER\_THREAD tables must be performed by hand.

    - Fixed: Erranous word filter tags on email notifications
             caused by format\_user\_name using add\_wordfilter\_tags
             rather than straight apply\_wordfilter.

               calls to thread\_get.
    - Changed: Removed join with THREAD table for
               message\_display. Instead we use the data we alread
               fetched from thread\_get.
    - Changed: My Controls pages layouts changed to move text
               away from the table border.
    - Changed: USER\_TIME\_LAST now USER\_TIME\_BEST and stores
               the user's longest session rather than last session.
    - Changed: URL truncating in admin\_users.php now uses
               parse\_url if possible to shorten URL to scheme and host
               only.
    - Changed: Attachments layout changed.
    - Changed: Poll groups are now seperated by a &lt;hr&gt; again.
    - Changed: New create\_poll.php that is more in fitting
               with post.php and other scripts.
    - Changed: Removed db.log debugging from DB functions.
    - Changed: Removed extra call to
               messages\_get\_most\_recent() and changed
               messages\_get\_most\_recent\_unread() to also look for read
               messages as well.
    - Changed: Removed joins on USER table for approved and
               edited logon. We now fetch that data seperatly if we
               need to.
    - Changed: user\_get\_prefs() changed query from COUNT to
               basic SELECT ... LIMIT 0, 1 style query.
    - Changed: Added Preview Voting Form button to
               edit\_poll.php
    - Changed: new edit\_poll.php that looks like
               create\_poll.php. No change in functionality otherwise.
    - Changed: Updated fr-ca language.
    - Changed: The individual light mode scripts now check to
               see if you have a saved logon cookie and redirect you
               if you're not logged in.
    - Changed: Replaced UTC time zones with GMT + country
               names
    - Changed: Updated Installer to add the relevant new PM
               exporting columns to USER\_PREFS (global) table.
    - Changed: Removed redudant final\_uri code from light mode
               as it doesn't do anything at the moment. Will work
               out a better way to handle it some time, but for now
               the frame set and the &lt;noframes&gt; tags and the whole
               redirecting causes too many headaches.
    - Changed: Removed lforums.php from robots.txt so that
               Google and co can index multiple forums under a single
               BH install.
    - Changed: Less Resource Intensive way of updating
               THREAD\_STATS table UNREAD\_PID, UNREAD\_CREATED columns.
    - Changed: Lack of LAST\_READ data is now calculated as
               threads are viewed and as the USER\_THREAD data is
               pruned rather than working it out on the fly with a
               join against the POST table.
    - Changed: Updated en-us and x-hacker language files.
    - Changed: Moved the invalid username / password prompt in
               logon.php to be within the frameset (uses a cookie to
               check if the logon was a failure)
    - Changed: Gave the Light mode the same functionality as
               the full thread list with the ability to mark a single
               folder as read.
    - Changed: Fixed spelling error "Where moved to" in
               en.inc.php
    - Changed: New CSS class for thread\_tracking\_notice rather
               than reusing text\_captcha\_error
    - Changed: Deleted threads can now be browsed by
               Moderators. Edit Thread Options link at bottom of page
               links to thread\_options.php to allow undelete.
    - Changed: Installer updated to reflect changes to
               USER\_PREFS table and USER\_TRACK table.
    - Changed: Removed Reply To links from PM Inbox export.
    - Changed: UTF-8 encoded files.
    - Changed: Removed redundant check from thread\_list.php
               which is now handled by thread\_get()
    - Changed: Funky queries for mark as read which literally
               take 2 to 3 seconds on default MySQl installation with
               no tuning! Not sure if these will work with MySQL 3.x.
               They should do because the manual mentions the method
               is available. Anyone want to test?
    - Changed: Reduced number of queries required to find
               threads with attachments for display of paperclip in
               thread list.
    - Changed: X-Hacker language doesn't show matching strings
               anymore like en-us.
    - Changed: Removed useless joins against GROUP\_USER and
               GROUP\_PERM tables from query in user\_logon function.
    - Changed: Probability of forum clean up functions running
               has been increased by default from 1 in 50 to 1 in 20
    - Changed: Only one forum clean up function is run per
               page load per user if they run at all. Prevents them
               running all at once and causing long page loads.
    - Changed: Removed POST table reindexes from upgrade and
               installer after running tests on Teh Forum.
    - Changed: All the wasteful SELECT COUNT queries have been
               changed to basic queries that fetch 1 row (LIMIT 0, 1)
               and 1 column (primary key)
    - Changed: PM export HTML now uses verbose date format to
               include day month and year.
    - Changed: Mucho faster emoticon class. Shaved over 400ms
               off the execution time (woo!)
    - Changed: new-install.php small change to prevent
               unneccesary processing after removal of conflicts.
    - Changed: bh\_session\_get\_perms\_by\_folder() is more
               efficient.
    - Changed: Moved test for USER\_PERM\_GUEST\_ACCESS into
               folder.inc.php.
    - Changed: folder\_get\_all() and folder\_get\_all\_by\_forum()
               now use the session data rather than requery the
               database.
    - Changed: Converted all BIT\_OR SQL calls for selecting or
               retrieving folders to the new bh\_session\_check\_perm()
               function.
    - Changed: Moved VIEWED column from THREAD table into a
               seperate THREAD\_STATS table.
    - Changed: USER\_TRACK table now records both the user's
               longest single session and their total session time.
    - Changed: Javascript threaded 'hack' to make the PM
               notification appear without disrupting the page
               loading.
    - Changed: Pluralisation of 'You have %d new PM" so we
               correctly get "You have 1 new PM" and "You have 2 new
               PMs"
    - Changed: Post count now is Thread count. Makes more
               sense. Duh.
    - Changed: bh\_session\_end() now uses current time rather
               than the session time.
    - Changed: Option to reset user permissions doesn't affect
               the user's moderation permission anymore.
    - Changed: USER\_POLL\_VOTES table structure changed to work
               on the primary key to make queries faster.
    - Changed: Probability code for update\_stats(),
               thread\_auto\_prune\_unread\_data(),
               bh\_remove\_stale\_sessions() and
               pm\_system\_prune\_folders()
               now used mt\_rand() rather than time() which means the
               functions are less likely to fire when two users load a
               page within milliseconds of each other.
    - Changed: PM Pruning, Stats Updating and Session Expiring
               code now all use the same probability before processing
               rather than every 15 minutes.
    - Changed: Thread pruning now uses a slightly higher
               probability as it wasn't ever firing on Teh Forum.
    - Changed: bh\_user\_update\_time() function to use less
               queries.
    - Changed: POST\_ATTACHMENT\_FILES table format changed
    - Changed: Switched join on thread and pm has\_attachment
               functions to make better use of the primary keys on
               PM\_ATTACHMENT\_IDS and POST\_ATTACHMENT\_IDS.
    - Changed: Removed join on THREAD table from poll display.
    - Changed: Removed KEYWORDS column from SEARCH\_RESULTS
               table and moved data to LAST\_SEARCH\_KEYWORDS in
               USER\_TRACK.
    - Changed: Call me nuts if you want but I've changed
               referrer back to referer. Spelt wrongly but correctly
               according to HTTP specification.
    - Changed: Limited bh\_delete\_expired\_sessions to 10 at a
               time to prevent the user who gets lumbered with the
               delete from waiting for the page to load.
    - Changed: User session length tracking now works for
               users who have browse anonymously switched on.
    - Changed: Removed WHERE from query that updates
               UNREAD\_PID and UNREAD\_CREATED columns so they always
               get updated!
    - Changed: Prevented guests from spoofing the thread list
               to get it to load thread types they can't view.
    - Changed: Added checks for guests and use shorter less
               complex queries with no relationships, interest or
               unread data.
    - Changed: Unread thread views limited to a maximum cut
               off period allows USER\_THREAD table to be pruned.
    - Changed: Updated English and German languages.
    - Changed: Updated en-us and x-hacker language files.
               fr-ca and de to come soon.
    - Changed: bh\_check\_languages now orders the problems it
               finds so it groups together missing strings,
               untranslated, unneeded, etc.
    - Changed: More comprehensive bh\_check\_languages.php
               script which can selectively turn on or off checking
               for untranslated strings.
    - Changed: bh\_ms\_word\_spelling\_check.php now writes the
               changes to en-new.inc.php rather than requiring you to
               do the changes manually.
    - Changed: Updated fr-ca translation.
    - Changed: Format of table key arrays changed so we can
               create named indexes so we don't create duplicate
               indexes on tables.
    - Removed: UTF-8 Page encoding. No idea how to fix the RSS
               output. Might just give in and flag it as a known
               issue.
    - Removed: Guest Auto logon optionas it doesn't work with
               the new session code where everybody is a guest even if
               they have a saved logon.
    - Removed: Unused logon error URL query when invalid
               username and password.
    - Removed: Useless call to thread\_can\_view which was
               pretty much duplicating the query in thread\_get.
    - Removed: thread\_can\_view function removed from
               thread.inc.php.
    - Removed: Undone the changes in the previous commit to
               the PM and thread have\_attachments functions.
    - Removed: CGI installer because it didn't work and was
               never maintained and was unsupported. Sorry peeps.

## What's new in 0.6.3 (Released 12th February 2006)

- Notes

    - BeehiveForum 0.6.3 fixed a few issues highlighted within
      the release of 0.6.2. For more detailed
      features of 0.6.2 please see the 0.6 release notes.

- Changes from 0.6.2

    - Fixed: html\_draw\_top() and html\_draw\_bottom() are now used for
             the frames pages (admin.php, discussion.php, index.php,
             start.php and user.php) so we correctly add the forum
             description and RSS feed links rather than the generic
             Beehive ones.
    - Fixed: Second attempt at fixing the error when updating your
             user prefs. Not even sure that the first patch didn't fix
             it to be honest.
    - Fixed: Added some code to disable register\_globals to prevent an
             exploit involving passing values in the URL
    - Fixed: Links pages weren't filtering the input correctly and
             were allowing HTML to be posted.
    - Fixed: potential exploit made available though page url var in
             admin.php
    - Fixed: Prevented the use of a hyphen in the forum webtag
             because it breaks things.
    - Fixed: Not being able to access restricted forum when access is
             applied correctly to user account.
    - Fixed: Clicking Change password / permissions button took you to the
             permissions page for the wrong forum.
    - Fixed: Removed align="middle" from images on all pages because they
             look out of place in the newer Gecko engine builds (FireFox 1.5)
    - Fixed: Thread list "there are no messages in this mode" text eas
             stuck to the bottom of the drop down in newer Gecko engine builds
             (FireFox 1.5)
    - Fixed: Missing html\_draw\_top() calls in edit\_signature.php when
             there is an error and also changed basetarget to \_blank so that when
             previewing signature any links open in new window/tab without the
             HTML needing a target attribute.
    - Fixed: Added tests for perm\_forumtools\_access() on post data so
             people can't send post data to change the user's nickname / password
             when they don't have access to it.
    - Fixed: forum settings array is constructed using only two queries
             now instead of 2 for current forum and another for global settings.
    - Fixed: Bug in admin\_user.php could allow user to loose access to
             Admin section on individual forums. Global perms were not affected
             by this bug.
    - Fixed: form\_quick\_button() wasn't looking at the right variable when
             you send it an array of var names and values
    - Fixed: Inconsistency in dictionary caused "(no suggestions)" to show
             when the dictionary had finished checking all words.
    - Fixed: Insert error when processing user post count when viewing a
             new user's (no posts) profile.
    - Fixed: Dictionary now works much better. It correctly matches words
             like couldn't, wouldn't and words in single quotes, it skips URLs,
             email address and HTML and doesn't corrupt unicode characters what
             so ever. It also correctly informs the user if there was no match in
             the dictionary instead of skiping over the word.
    - Fixed: Unicode characters were being corrupted by Javascript when
             sending the text back after using the dictionary.
    - Fixed: Emoticons and signature boxes couldn't be reshown once hidden
             on post, edit and pm\_write pages but reloading them made them show
             again.
    - Fixed: edit\_attachments.php was showing "Other attachments" in My
             Controls when it shouldn't.
    - Fixed: Removed debug code from forums.php
    - Fixed: Query being executed twice in when fetching forum list for
             'My Forums' and potentially undefined variable causing error.
    - Fixed: user\_stats.php no longer fetches the user prefs because it is
             told what to do by messages.php
    - Fixed: Undefined variable $install\_cgi\_mode when using the web
             interface to install.
    - Fixed: Attachment view count was incremented each time a thumbnail
             of an image was seen.
    - Fixed: load\_language\_file not working sometimes because of
             include\_once being used rather than include
    - Fixed: 404 page not found error when you click Continue upon
             finishing the install because you've just deleted install.php.
    - Fixed: Table structure for LINKS\_FOLDER had been mangled and was no
             longer allowing NULL on PARENT\_FID
    - Fixed: new-install.php no longer creates the old SEARCH\_KEYWORDS,
             SEARCH\_POSTS and SEARCH\_MATCH tables.
    - Fixed: wordwrap plan didn't work because it seems to trim lines it
             wraps on some OSes and not others?
    - Added: html\_draw\_top() now accepts a body\_tag argument which stops
             the function from drawing the body tag, as used in the frames pages.
    - Added: Favourites checkbox and button to Guest MyForums with an
             error about needing to login.
    - Added: Probability test to see if we should clean the stale user
             sessions. Defaults to 10% probability.
    - Added: Error out when ever the user's search query is affected by
             the MySQL full-text stop words
    - Added: User stats differentiates between you (shown in bold), other
             users and your friends (shown in italic) and includes tooltips which
             tell you that you are Invisible or not.
    - Added: By request search now tells you which words were invalid in
             your search query.
    - Added: Relevance to searches. BH doesn't do anything with it, but I
             might sneak something in before 0.6.2
    - Added: Drop down added to search results to allow quick switching of
             order and removed it from the actual search query.
    - Added: Post count caching to USER\_TRACK table to reduce the load
             caused by someone opening a user profile.
    - Changed: user\_font.php no longer loads the user's prefs as that
               part is handled by messages.php.
    - Changed: Made 06x upgrade script drop the SEARCH\_RESULTS table
               before attempting to create it.
    - Changed: Slight change to word wrapping in thread list and start
               page.
    - Changed: All pages now use our DTD. Can't get the W3 validator to
               see it though, but FireFox reports it is in Standards Compliance
               mode. Hmm.
    - Changed: bh\_check\_languages.php can now help to find strings which
               haven't been translated.
    - Changed: Removed call to threads\_any\_unread() in discussion.php,
               admin\_post\_approve.php, delete.php and edit.php
    - Changed: Only users who are perm\_forumtools\_access() can change
               another user's nickname and password.
    - Changed: bh\_session\_remove\_stale() is now only called when the
               user's session is about to expire.
    - Changed: Removed and / or based drop down from search and allow
               users to compose their own boolean searches.
    - Changed: Kick button is now available to global admins rather than
               just forum tools users
    - Changed: Dictionary is now case insensitive and with new primary
               key much quicker.
    - Changed: Removed count() query from thread\_has\_attachments and
               simply made it fetch the AID of the attachment
    - Changed: Removed count() query from thread\_any\_unread and made it
               fetch the TID.PID of the thread instead.
    - Changed: Encoding on some files changed to UTF-8 PC line endings
    - Changed: emoticon\_get\_sets() to have an optional function argument
               that hides the none and text emoticons
    - Changed: Attachments now sort alphabetically. Previously updating
               the attachment to say how many times it has viewed bumped it to
               the top of the list causing confusion when people pointed towards
               "attachment #1" rather than naming them by filename.
    - Changed: More tweaks to search which makes things a heck of a lot
               quicker!
    - Changed: Finding an old post to index is more friendly to the
               server hopefully.
    - Changed: Removed use of function \_in\_array() as defined in
               format.inc.php because it takes too long to process anything.
    - Changed: Updated language files.
    - Changed: Guests no longer help to index posts to help reduce load
               on server.
    - Changed: thread\_list.php and start\_left.php now wordwrap thread
               titles so they don't cause a horizontal scrollbar in the frame.
    - Changed: upgrade-06RC-to-06.php replaced with a generic script
               which will upgrade all 0.6 releases thus far to 0.6.2.
    - Changed: upgrade-05-to-06.php replaced with upgrade-05-to-062.php.
    - Changed: start\_form != start\_from.
    - Changed: robots.txt. 1st stage of Google Friendly Beehive.
    - Changed: Search now checks to see if it is running MySQL 4 and if
               so allows a choice between AND and OR based searches
    - Changed: Guests can no longer perform searches
    - Changed: Different way to check for results from user search which
               should be less server intensive.
    - Changed: Few more changes to the start\_main.php example script.
    - Changed: Removed gmmktime() and changed back to mktime() so we use
               the server timezone.
    - Changed: Removed all the search indexing code because it was a bad
               experiment that didn't work out. Going to concentrate of
               optimising BH to use MySQL FULLTEXT searches instead.
    - Changed: \_htmlentities now leaves single-quotes alone so they
               won't get mangled in the database.
    - Changed: search\_index.php now says which post it has just indexed.
    - Removed: search\_min\_word\_length setting as BH now uses the MySQL
               defaults (for MySQL &lt; 4.0 the values are fixed at 4 and 84)
    - Removed: Text at bottom of search dialog is no longer relevant
               because BH now errors out instead.

## What's new in 0.6.2 (Released 30th Nov 2005)

- Notes

    - BeehiveForum 0.6.2 fixes a few issues highlighted within
      the release of 0.6 and 0.6.1. For more detailed

             when deleted. Changed so that only attachments not owned by the moderator /
             admin are logged when deleted.
    - Fixed: Bug in attachments when thumbnail could not be read (i.e. corrupted file,
             permissions error, locked file, etc).
    - Fixed: Stream lined the number fo queries that $dictionary-&gt;word\_get\_suggestions()
             makes by checking that the word we're checking is well formed first.

             out.
    - Fixed: Dictionary now correctly identifies html tags and doesn't check them.

    - Fixed: Error when folder has no ALLOWED\_TYPE set.

    - Fixed: bh\_session\_check() was being called twice by the thread list once by itself
             and again by the RSS feed checker
    - Fixed: Added an @ on line 153 of forum.inc.php to suppress warning when no default
             forum and no ?webtag in querystring. This might be a dirty way to fix it,
             but i can't see why it'd break anything?

             after.

             now check to see if the frequency is set to 0 (disabled) before checking.
    - Fixed: search.inc.php couple of bugs in new frequency test code - line 621
             incorrect var name $minimum\_post\_frequency, assumed it should be
             $search\_min\_frequency, changed. Similarly, line 630, $last\_search\_check,
             assumed it should be $last\_search\_stamp, changed.
    - Fixed: Removed debugging code (oops!) and fixed missing semi-colon from query
             resulting in error.
    - Fixed: Relevance wasn't being calculated correctly due to missing IN BOOLEAN MODE
             in SELECT.

             friends (shown in italic) and includes tooltips which tell you that you are

    - Added: Link to stop words list on search form.
    - Added: "Search Results" selection to thread list drop down.

             removed it from the actual search query.
    - Added: english.dic didn't have I'm in it and lots of people had added it on Teh...
    - Added: Further explanation to search\_index.php about being able to use webtag on
             the CLI
    - Added: Return-path header to email functions. Seems to do nothng for tehforum but
             it has no negative effect either.
    - Added: Made Beehive check the arv array for a webtag so you can now call BH's
             scripts from the CLI (webtag must be 1st arg!)

             opening a user profile.
    - Added: Missing xhtml-lat1.ent, xhtml-special.ent, xhtml-symbol.ent to CVS. Don't
             really know if I should be including this or if I can reference them in the

## What's new in 0.6.1 (Released 22nd Aug 2005)

- Notes

    - BeehiveForum 0.6.1 fixes a few issues highlighted within
      the final release of 0.6. There are no functional changes
      to the software at this time. For more detailed features
      of 0.6.1 please see the 0.6 release notes.

- Changes from 0.6

    - Fixed: Forum level admins were able to remove the global
             privilleges of another user without having global
             forum privilleges themselves.
    - Fixed: Upgrading from 0.5 to 0.6 sometimes results in an
             error with primary keys on SEARCH\_POST table.
    - Fixed: Buffer error occured when using MSIE browser and
             being forced to download the config.inc.php when
             installing Beehive.
    - Fixed: Forum shown was always the default forum even if the
             webtag was valid.
    - Fixed: My Forums page would not display the message count on
             the forum if the forum had no messages or the user
             had not previously visited the forum.
    - Fixed: Missing SEARCH\_RESULTS table when performing a new
             installation of BeehiveForum 0.6 or upgrading from
             a 0.5 installation.
    - Fixed: Missing FORUM column in SEARCH\_RESULTS table when
             upgrading from 0.6RC1 / RC2 to 0.6 final.

## What's new in 0.6 ("Honey Lingers", released 18th Aug 2005)

- Notes

    - BeehiveForum 0.6 introduces a new search indexing procedure
      which will unfortunately skew the search results of your forum
      while it catches up and performs the indexing. If you have a
      lot of posts this will take a long time to complete. To help
      reduce the time required in the indexing your old posts,
      included is search\_index.php which is suitable for running
      from a cron or schedule job. Posts created after upgrading
      to 0.6 will be indexed as they are created.

    - New Admin logging options require 0.6 to clear your current
      Admin Log before upgrading. This is at the expense of
      improved logging. If you want to keep your old logs please
      view and save the HTML output or export the ADMIN\_LOG table
      for each forum.

- Brand new features

    - Installation can now be completed via CLI over telnet / SSH.
    - RSS Feed propagation allows the replication of an RSS feed
      into threads on your forum. Useful for news headlines from
      other sites to promote discussion.
    - Added constant for the include files path so that developers
      can reuse the Beehive include files while placing their own
      scripts outside of the main forum folder.
    - Post Approval options allows moderators to optionally approve
      posts before they are displayed to other users.
    - Email address confirmation for new user registrations.
    - Text Captcha options for new user registrations to help
      prevent scripts and bots from creating user accounts.
    - TinyMCE WYSIWYG integration with BeehiveForum's compose
      pages.
    - French Canadian (fr-ca) language file. Thanks to Jo from
      Canadian Politics Forums <http://www.canadian-politics.com/>
    - Forums can be opened, closed, restricted or password protected
      without requiring access to the 'Manage Forums' section. A new
      option allows a user with access to the 'Manage Forums' section
      to disable a forum which will hide it from the My Forums list
      as per 0.5's behaviour.
    - WikiWiki integration allows Beehive to automatically hyperlink
      CamalCase words as used by most popular Wiki sites.
    - Wiki-esq quick links for linking to a specific post using
      msg:1.1 or to user's profile using user:Logon.
    - Attachments allow for the creation of thumbnails in posts for
      supported file types (*.png, *.jpg, *.gif). Requires GD library
      to be compiled in with PHP.

      posts without having to be given moderator privileges.

      Messages sections and correctly prevent access to the related
      pages.

      mode independently of the server clock and user time zone.
    - Added option to prevent users from ignoring admin.
    - Default New User registration settings including email notification
      PM notification, etc. can be defined in Global Forum Settings.
    - Added &lt;label for=""&gt; to checkboxes and radio buttons which allow
      for clickable text to toggle form elements.
    - Added post stats page to Admin tools which can be used to find
      the Top 20 posters during specified period.

- Enhanced old features

    - Greatly improved Unicode UTF-8 support which should make it
      possible to type in different alphabets in the same post.
    - Improved user permissions handling to be more consistent and
      less prone to problems. A lot of the niggles you've all
      encountered with 0.5's permissions should be fixed in 0.6.
    - Ban controls now allow banning of IP Addresses, Logons,
      Nicknames and email addresses, all by wildcard matching.
    - Better search indexing added which generates less load on
      MySQL
      server when a user performs a search.
    - Better Admin log with less possibility for display of Unknown
      User, Unknown Thread / Post, etc.
    - Added ability for Admin to change user's password.
    - Re-added User Alias list on User page, but removed IP banning
      option as this is now handled by the new Ban Controls section.

      more precise in matching whole words.
    - Links and Link folders are now sorted alphabetically by
      default.
    - Replaced Beautifier with Geshi - Generic Syntax Highlighter.
    - Improved user permissions allow for separate Links section
      and Post moderators as well as better global Admin who
      can optionally moderate over all forums.

      distribute emoticon packs that are easy to install.
    - Attachments now always open in a new window / tab.

      file uploads.

      Shockwave and Flash files.

    - Greatly improved the start page editor and style sheet editor
      with more useful error messages and help for write protected
      files and folders.
    - Added Deleted by text and time / date stamp on deleted messages.
    - Prevented users from blocking moderators and stopping them
      from sending them PMs.

      said "Sent by X from a Beehive Forum"

    - Better detection for when a user's session expires, giving them
      more control over logging back in with minimal fuss.
    - Fixed all user preference updates so they don't affect all
      forums. Changing things like post page settings, font size,
      toggling stats display now only affects the forum a user is
      currently visiting rather than all of them.
    - Re-added display of Guests to Recent Visitors list.

- General Bug fixes

    - Fixed call to undefined function user\_change\_pw() fixed. A
      patch is also available to fix separately this problem in 0.5

      compression was enabled on a PHP installation that was compiled
      without ZLIB.
    - Lots of IIS server fixes.
    - Lots and lots more!

- Known issues

    - Threads created from RSS Feeds are known to have problems
      with some characters displaying incorrectly where the
      character encoding of the feed is different to that of
      the output generated by the BeehiveForum software.
    - Incorrect HTML contained within RSS Feeds will be rendered
      correctly (shown as HTML entities) due to aggressive checking
      used by BeehiveForum to make sure broken HTML doesn't break
      the display of the messages.

- Changes from 0.6RC2

    - Added: 4th table to search (SEARCH\_RESULTS) which stores a
             users search results for quicker retrieval across
             result pages and to get around the problem with the
             search frequency.

    - Changed: Updated language files and removed unneeded strings.

               the tidarray contains the TID and LENGTH so we don't
               have to query to fetch them.
    - Changed: edit\_prefs.php so it keeps the entered user data
               even if it contains an error so that the user can
               correct it without having to completely retype it.
    - Changed: Made admin\_user\_groups table wider

               prefix. Works the same as get\_table\_prefix but takes
               a forum id and queries the table rather than using
               the webtag URI query.
    - Changed: Users with forum tools permissions can access
               password protected forums without entering a
               password.

- Changes from 0.6RC1

    - Fixed: error handler falling over itself if the $\_POST
             variables contains an array. Handled by a function in
             form.inc.php that can be used by other scripts if
             required.
    - Fixed: error in get\_request\_uri which trips over $\_GET
             variable containing an array. Handled by a seperate
             function to the one in form.inc.php as this one is
             required to construct a URL query from them.
    - Fixed: post content preview was being chopped incorrectly in
             search results
    - Fixed: search was not working as expected when a user
             searched for words by a user and the word was in the
             MySQL stop list.
    - Fixed: redid all the transparency on all the Default style
             images and made sure they were 15x15 pixels.
    - Fixed: Several changes to make Beehive more friendly to
             non-english translations.
    - Fixed: attachments being deleted prevents moderators from
             gaining access to the edit attachments page of a post
             for another user.
    - Fixed: Made all edit pages check for and create an AID record
             in the relevant ATTACHMENTS table in order to prevent
             replacing it and loosing link between posts and
             attachments.
    - Fixed: pm\_save\_attachment\_id() causing problems when a PM
             already has an attachment ID. It now checks the
             database first same as post\_save\_attachment\_id does.
    - Fixed: all final\_uri queries now check to make sure the
             string is longer than 0 chars.

    - Fixed: grammar error in "You have 1 a new PM" language
             string.
    - Fixed: PM's always showing as having attachments. Added a new
             function to pm.inc.php called pm\_has\_attachments()
             which will actually check the POST\_ATTACHMENT\_FILES
             table for attachments same as the
             thread\_has\_attachments() does.
    - Fixed: user\_get\_aliases() no longer include empty IPAddress
             matches in the check.
    - Fixed: moved USER\_PREF modifications out of 0.5-to-0.6
             upgrader foreach loop into main part of installer so
             they are only performed once.
    - Fixed: undefined variable $db\_post\_save\_attachment\_id on line
             722 of pm.inc.php
    - Fixed: logon drop down not working on expired session page.
    - Fixed: missing [1 new from thread list.
    - Fixed: Guest error login link loosing URL query due to it not
             being encoded correctly.
    - Fixed: [x new of y] wrapping incorrectly by adding
             white-space: nowrap to CSS
    - Fixed: "Ararar" error message in thread\_options.php
    - Fixed: missing rawurlencode call in parse\_url function which
             broke the ?msg thing in email links.

             tickbox unticked.
    - Fixed: logging in from light mode and then visiting the full
             mode triggers showing the logon dialog even though
             you've never visted it before.
    - Fixed: static webtag in poll.inc.php and upgrade-05-to-06.php
    - Fixed: undefined variable $lang in poll.inc.php
    - Fixed: Removed erranous space from end of constants.inc.php
             that trips up if the output buffering is disabled.
    - Fixed: undefined variable $settings\_array in forum.inc.php
    - Fixed: undefined $db\_install in forum.inc.php
    - Fixed: removing a forum didn't remove the RSS\_FEEDS and
             RSS\_HISTORY tables for that forum
    - Fixed: header\_redirect problem when msie\_buffer\_fix() is
             called producing output before headers
    - Fixed: undefined variable $chunks\_array in format.inc.php
    - Fixed: undefined variable $chunks in format.inc.php
    - Changed: Simplified the calls to the email notification
               functions requiring a msg and splitting it into
               tid.pid when the function is called by joining
               the tid & pid!
    - Changed: RSS feed now duplicates the headline in the quote
               tag so if it gets truncated by Beehive's 64 char
               limit on thread titles we still get to see it all.
    - Changed: All '{$table\_data['FID']}' changed to $forum\_fid
               to make things neater and easier to understand.
    - Changed: Truncating of RSS thread title now works the same
               as the search results.
    - Changed: Reformatted user\_profile.php page so it should
               display better.
    - Changed: Added error checking to installer/upgrade scripts.

               auto-re-enable when the search results have
               successfully loaded.
    - Changed: logon.php and logout.php to not use the expired
               session page. Makes sense, no?
    - Changed: Removed &lt;bdo&gt; tags from thread\_list.php
    - Changed: Added CDATA tags to the &lt;title&gt; element of the RSS
               Feed which should help with FireFox not being able
               to use the output.
    - Changed: Added an exclude\_keys array list to
               form\_input\_hidden\_array so you can specify named
               keys to skip.
    - Changed: Added \_array\_chunk function which mimics
               PHP &gt; 4.2.0's own function.
    - Changed: search indexing to ignore keywords with numerals
               only (like: '000', '999', '911', '666' etc)
    - Changed: search indexing now chunks the keywords and
               performs multiple queries in chunks of 20 keywords
               in order to stop MySQL failing when the number of
               words to index in one query is greater than the
               highest extended query count.
    - Changed: Removed directory creation functionality from
               admin\_default\_forum\_settings.php and added a
               function that is called by the script and all
               the other attachment scripts to check and create
               the directory. The text captcha class already does
               this.
    - Changed: Removed all the width and height attributes from
               image tags to stop those images which are larger
               or smaller from being resized by the browser.
    - Changed: Added optional UID argument to all the perm\_*
               functions that require it.
    - Changed: Added optional argument to disable ip address
               logging as used by the RSS feed
    - Chamged: Added extra index to USER\_POLL\_VOTES (TID,
               OPTION\_ID) to improve poll performance
    - Changed: RSS Feed so it only fetches 10 feed items per update

## What's new in 0.5 ("What You Have Is Enough", released 10th Dec 2004)

- Notes

    - Beehive Forum 0.5 corrected a very large scale problem with
      stripslashes which means that content created with prior
      versions may be subject to erroneous display once you
      upgrade to 0.5.

- Brand new features

    - Multiple Forum support. Yes, finally you can run more than
      one forum on your web space using a single Beehive
      installation, under a 'My Forums' linking system.
    - Forums can be open/closed/restricted/passworded.
    - Install/upgrade script simplifies installation process.
    - Comprehensive user permissions - users can be given/denied access
      to post/read/moderate etc. in specific folders, as well as having
      HTML/sig privileges given/denied.

    - Emoticon preview pane on post page for quick reference.
    - Users can now perform basic moderation duties on their own
      posts on the new 'Thread Options' page, including changing
      the thread title and moving the thread to different folders.
      Admins can prevent this functionality by 'edit locking' the
      thread to prevent it from being changed.
    - Users can access 'Thread Options' by clicking the icon to
      the left of every thread title in the thread list frame.
      From here a thread can be ignored without ever reading it.
    - Posts can now be marked as unread, for later reading.
    - New 'Reply as PM' link on every post will quickly create a new PM
      addressed to the post author, with the thread title as the subject.

      you're planning on seeing tonight's killer plot twist. &lt;spoiler&gt;He
      was dead all along!!&lt;/spoiler&gt;
    - &lt;noemots&gt; tag to prevent anything within it from being converted to
      an emoticon.
    - New post page preferences which allow you to toggle the HTML
      toolbar, the emoticons preview pane and the signature text
      field. You can also choose an HTML mode by default; you can
      choose to enable/disable emoticons in your messages by
      default and so on.
    - English Language Dictionary available from the HTML Toolbar
      which can be configured to auto-check spelling each time you
      post.
    - Guest account no longer requires cookies, so that search engines can
      spider Beehive forums. A robots.txt file is also included to help

      poll creation; signature editing; PM creation; PM editing;
      start page editing. Can't get enough of that HTML toolbar.
    - Slicker HTML integration - &lt;quote&gt;/&lt;code&gt;/&lt;spoiler&gt; tags won't show
      their innards, for example.
    - Better editing page. No longer will you have to toggle between a
      plain-text/HTML version of your post - BH will automatically
      approximoguesstimate what settings you originally posted your
      message with.
    - Polls can now be 'soft-edited' - minor edits which won't reset the
      votes.
    - Poll options can either be displayed as radio buttons (as before) or
      as a drop-down list.
    - Improved word filter that allows you to find and replace
      rather than obscure the filtered words with asterix.

      filter list of the current entries. Useful if browsing from

    - Many pages have had their output tweaked so they fit in with
      the overall style of beehive.

      still show (with the link removed) in posts.
    - Alternative attachment method which allows Beehive to make
      use of the old 0.3 and older attachment retrieval method for
      servers that can't handle the newer method.
    - The search page has been remade with a better design and
      better functionality.
    - 'Page [1] 2 3 ...' on various pages rewritten a bit posher.

- Fixes

    - Lots and lots!

- Known Issues

    - Content created prior to the installation of 0.5 will be
      incorrectly escaped (all ' and " characters will appear as
      \'and \" respectively). This is due to a major bug in
      versions prior to 0.5 which meant content inserted into
      the database was double-escaped.

      explanatory message at the same time as you post the poll.
    - Various new UI stuff - friend / attachment icons in the
      thread list, link back to the voting form in a poll thread.
    - Polls are now slightly more anonymous (at least, it's not
      trivial for someone with database access to see how you
      voted, but neither is it secure).
    - Users can choose to be directed straight to the forum
      (bypassing the start page) when logging in.
    - The time a user last logged on and the total number of posts
      they have made on the forum are displayed in their profile.
    - You can now ignore only someone's signature, or globally
      ignore all signatures if you want.
    - Mark as Read has more options (all discussions, visible
      discussions, next 50 discussions)

- Fixes

    - We've given the code a spring clean - hopefully there are now
      no PHP errors/warnings/notices at all.
    - Various fixes to make things work properly with
      Microsoft-IIS.
    - Some fixes to properly support PHP 4.3.x.
    - Some of the database stuff (mainly thread list queries) has
      been optimised for efficiency.
    - Database errors are now caught in a nice way.
    - Some session handling improvements

## What's new in 0.2 ("Let It Bee", released 12th September 2002)

- User Selectable Styles: Forum members can now select from a number of
  styles to change the appearance of the forum. Pretty much everything
  can be styled, by editing the CSS files and altering the images.
- Polls: Polls are now enabled. They let people vote, and stuff.
- Attachments: Forum owners can optionally enable the attachments
  feature, allowing members to upload files to the forum server.
  Space available per member can be limited.
- Forgot password: Muppets who forget their passwords can now get an
  e-mail to the address they entered, with a link where they can reset
  the password.
- Guest access: Casual browsers can access forums as guests, but can
  not post.
- Lots of little things: Little enhancements here and there that just
  generally make things nicer. Like friend icons in the message view,
  and multiple logins being saveable.
- Discontinued undocumented features: Most of the undocumented features
  from 0.1 have been removed, such as the undocumented feature where
  fix\_html would occasionally loop until PHP timed out, and the famous
  "time-travelling" undocumented feature where post's creation times
  were updated when they were read by the user they were addressed to.
- New undocumented features: It is possible that the addition of the
  new documented features has resulted in the accidental addition of
  new undocumented features. If you believe you have found an
  undocumented feature, please let us know in the test forum at
  <http://beehiveforum.co.uk/forum>
- \o/ Domain name \o/: We got the domain name registered, so you can
  now use <http://beehiveforum.co.uk> for all your Beehive URL needs.
  It's still hosted on SourceForge <http://sf.net>, lovely people that
  they are.
