Beehive Forum Styles
====================

Some of the foler names for the styles contain uppercase characters, but to
maintain cross-platform compatibility, please ensure they are all in
lowercase when creating a new distribution to place on SF.net (or whatever)

Don't ask why this happened, because I refuse to explain why.
