      <p>Hello and welcome to the Project Beehive test forum.</p>
      <p>Now, before we start, it should be noted that this is a test forum and it should be kept that way. By all means post messages, test it out and tell people about it, but please don't invite all your mates over here and adopt it as your permanent residence.</p>
      <p>As unlikely as it sounds, this forum is highly likely to contain bugs. I know what youâ€™re thinking, how could it possibly contain bugs with such mind numbingly brilliant developers aboard? Enough of the ego inflating I think. In all seriousness if you find a bug please leave a post detailing what it is that happened, what you expected to happen and what it is you were doing when it happened. All of this information will help considerably in locating the problem and getting it sorted. Even better if you know how and why it happened, right down to the line number in the source code, please tell us, as it will make things even easier.</p>
      <p>Now, come on in!</p>
      <p><b>Guidelines:</b></p>
      <p>There really aren't really any forum rules to be adhered to, but it should be noted that although we will tolerate casual swearing, we will not tolerant "flaming", deliberate and directed swearing, spam, homophobia, racism and general bigotry aimed at anyone, forum member or otherwise, so don't think you're going to get away with it. You have been warned.</p>
