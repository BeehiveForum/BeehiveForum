1. About Beehive
================

1.1 What is Beehive?
====================

Beehive is an online forum/message board system with several powerful features:
- Frames-based layout (OK, some people hate frames, but they really are handy
  when you're using a forum like this)
- Per-user tracking of read and unread posts
- E-mail notification when someone posts a message to you
- Polls
- Attachments to posts
- Customisable colour schemes and styles
- The ability to ignore folders that do not interest you
- Restricted-access folders
- A comprehensive user administration system, including some imaginative ways to
  ban persistent idiots (like the "Worm" mode, where the idiot in question
  thinks things are going on as normal but all his posts show as deleted to
  other users), and the ability to elect moderators to run the forum
- Fully customisable user profiles
- A powerful search facility

1.2 Who wrote it?
=================

Beehive has been written by several members of what is now called "Teh Forum", 
which can be found at http://www.tehforum.co.uk/forum/. A full list of credits 
appears in readme.txt.

1.3 Why did you write it?
=========================

Until mid-2002, we were a (reasonably) happy community on Delphi Forums - the 
ads were a bit irritating, but the forums themselves were powerful and had some 
nifty features. Then Delphi decided to change their charging policy, with the
result that those users who didn't want to pay would have to use a rather
crippled system.

At that point, we wondered if there were any credible alternatives to Delphi. 
After a lot of searching, we discovered that whilst some other forum software 
offers similar features, none offered quite what we were after. Particularly, we 
wanted forum software that was guaranteed to remain free - i.e. released under
some type of open-source licence.

Various members of the forum had the required skills to develop our own solution
(for some, software development and web design is their day job). So we did, and 
released it in a way that allows everyone to use it if they so desire. Beehive is
the result.

1.4 Can I use Beehive on my own web site?
=========================================

Of course you can (provided your server has PHP and MySQL installed - see
readme.txt for more details). Beehive is released under the GNU General Public 
License (a copy of which is included with this distribution). That means that 
you may freely use, modify, and even distribute it (we encourage you to do this)
. However, the conditions of the license require that any work derived from 
Beehive must be identified as such, and also be released under the GPL - i.e.,
you cannot sell Beehive commercially. For more information, read the text of the
GPL in the file called COPYING.


2. Installing Beehive and getting it to work
============================================

2.1 Where to find installation instructions
===========================================

Installing Beehive is covered in readme.txt. It's a fairly simple process,
though it could be made simpler, and doubtless will be in later releases.


3. Technical questions
======================

3.1 How scalable is Beehive?
============================

We've found that Beehive can easily handle our forum (http://www.tehforum.co.uk/),
which is pretty high-traffic. The database layout is designed with efficiency in 
mind, and we leave it up to MySQL to do all the big data-crunching. In short, 
don't worry (provided you have enough disk space to store the database, you'll 
be fine).

3.2 Why did you write it in PHP?
================================

Because PHP is the best language ever, ever. It's fast, very powerful, and free. 
You can run Beehive without paying any software costs (use Linux, Apache, MySQL, 
and PHP). The other, more practical reason is that we already knew it.


4. Other questions
==================

4.1 Why the fixation with bees?
===============================

We're not really sure. The name Beehive was suggested since we wanted something 
that reflected the forum as a community (which, after all, is what a beehive is).
If you're not that keen on bees, you can change the default style to one of the 
others, and the bees will be gone. The forum owner will still be called the 
"queen", but tough. No-one has to know that, anyway.

4.2 I hate frames. Why did you use them?
========================================

The community which is now Teh Forum has used many different types of online 
discussion media in its time. And this is our favourite. Sorry.


5. Improving Beehive
====================

5.1 Beehive doesn't do x. Can you make it do that?
==================================================

We welcome feedback, bug reports, and requests for extra features etc. The best
place is to ask is probably the forum at http://beehiveforum.net/forum/. But 
bear in mind that we do this in our spare time.

Of course, since Beehive is open source, you could always implement whatever 
feature you want yourself. We'd love you to submit patches.


6. Troubleshooting
==================

6.1 Database connectivity problems or permission denied errors
==============================================================

If you are experiencing connectivity problems or permission denied errors, check
that you have edited the config.inc.php so that the database details match those
provided by your hosting provider. Be sure to double check the username and
password. If they are incorrect your Beehive Forum will fail to function.

6.2 Unknown or missing table errors
===================================

In the case of unknown or missing table errors, be sure that you have correctly
and successfully imported the schema.sql file in the docs folder of the Beehive
Forum Distribution. If you experience errors during the import, check that your
version of MySQL is recent enough (see readme.txt for requirements)

6.3 Blank page errors
=====================

Blank pages can be caused by enabling the gzip compression support in your
Beehive Forum's config.inc.php. Problems arise when the server already has gzip
compression for PHP scripts enabled or a 3rd party compression library such as
mod_gzip is installed. Before reporting this as a bug, try disabling the gzip
compression in config.inc.php of your Beehive Forum by changing the
$gzip_compress_output variable to False.

6.4 Error: Strict Standards: var: Deprecated on PHP/5.x
=======================================================

With PHP/5.0 the var modifier for variables within classes has been deprecated,
hence the error message. Under normal circumstances this wouldn't be a problem
as the error reporting level is by default set the same as PHP/4.x. However
if the level is increased to include E_STRICT, a new reporting level which
is designed to notify on less than recommended coding practices, the above error
will occur when using your BeehiveForum. At the moment the only work around
for this is to disable / step down the error reporting to E_ALL or below.

6.5 Email Notifications on Windows
==================================

Please see readme.txt section 1.2.12 for information on setting up PHP to send
email on Windows platforms.
