// Use this script in a CRON job or other schedule to index
// your forum's posts automatically. How often you want the
// script to be executed is entirely up to you, but we recommend
// no more than once every 5 minutes. Whatever value you choose
// remember that this script will only index *1* post each time
// it is run so if you have a lot of posts it could be some time
// before your entire database is indexed.

// You can optionally add the webtag of the forum you wish to index
// as a command line argument to the script if you run multiple
// forums on your BeehiveForum installation. If you don't specify
// a webtag or you specify an invalid webtag the script will index
// your default forum only. If you do not have a default forum no
// posts will be indexed.

// Example command line:

// php /home/account_name/public_html/forum/search_index.php WEBTAG

// Constant to define where the include files are
define("BH_INCLUDE_PATH", "./include/");

include_once(BH_INCLUDE_PATH. "search.inc.php");
