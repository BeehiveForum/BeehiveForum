                      BUGS - list of known bugs in GeSHi
                               Version 1.0.5

- Putting a > inside an HTML comment will close the comment abruptly. There's nothing that
  can be done about this (at least in the 1.0.X series of GeSHi), but version 1.2 will fix
  this bug.
- Number highlighting is quite poor [possibly better now]
- I'm not happy with URLS - there still could be extra bugs, and it's rather unflexible
  (see TODO for a possible fix)
- "Important" sections for some reason seem to have their spans added after every
  newline up until the next lexic, instead of stopping at the <END GeSHi> part. In fact,
  context sensitiveness is quite poor...
- Using the extra line number highlighting feature without actually using line numbers
  will result in malformed XHTML (not sure about this one though...)
- Slow!!! Especially for source with lots of strings in it. GeSHi will work acceptably
  for sourcecode under 5K (for simple language files like SQL, a 100K file can be
  highlighted in just 6 seconds), but above about 25K things get a little slow... If
  you're using this as part of some larger software, you may want to think about
  making some sort of "cache" effect to speed things up and reduce server load.
- Using encoding other than ISO-8859-1 is a problem, however it hasn't quite been pinpointed yet
