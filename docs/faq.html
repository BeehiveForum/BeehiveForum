        <h2>1. About Beehive</h2>

             <h3>1.1 What is Beehive?</h3>
                  <p>Beehive is an online forum/messageboard system with several powerful features:
                      <ul>
                          <li>Frames-based layout (OK, some people hate frames, but they really are handy when you're using a forum like this)</li>
                          <li>Per-user tracking of read and unread posts</li>
                          <li>Email notification when someone posts a message to you</li>
                          <li>Polls</li>
                          <li>Attatchments to posts</li>
                          <li>Customisable colour schemes and styles</li>
                          <li>The ability to ignore folders that do not interest you</li>
                          <li>Restricted-access folders</li>
                          <li>A comprehensive user administration system, including some imaginative ways to ban persistent idiots (like the "Worm" mode, where the idiot in question thinks things are going on as normal but all his posts show as deleted to other users), and the ability to elect moderators to run the forum</li>
                          <li>Fully customisable user profiles</li>
                          <li>A powerful search facility</li>
                      </ul>
             <h3>1.2 Who wrote it?</h3>
                 <p>Beehive has been written by several members of what is now called "Teh Forum",
                 which can be found at http://www.tehforum.co.uk/forum/. A full list of credits
                 appears in readme.txt.</p>

             <h3>1.3 Why did you write it?</h3>
                 <p>Until mid-2002, we were a (reasonably) happy community on Delphi Forums - the
                 ads were a bit irritating, but the forums themselves were powerful and had some
                 nifty features. Then Delphi decided to change their charging policy, with the
                 result that those users who didn't want to pay would have to use a rather
                 crippled system.</p>

                 <p>At that point, we wondered if there were any credible alternatives to Delphi.
                 After a lot of searching, we discovered that whilst some other forum software
                 offers similar features, none offered quite what we were after. Particularly, we
                 wanted forum software that was guaranteed to remain free - i.e. released under
                 some type of open-source licence.</p>

                 <p>Various members of the forum had the required skills to develop our own solution
                 (for some, software development and web design is their day job). So we did, and
                 released it in a way that allows everyone to use it if they so desire. Beehive is
                 the result.</p>

             <h3>1.4 Can I use Beehive on my own web site?</h3>
                 <p>Of course you can (provided your server has PHP and MySQL installed - see
                 readme.txt for more details). Beehive is released under the GNU General Public
                 License (a copy of which is included with this distribution). That means that
                 you may freely use, modify, and even distribute it (we encourage you to do this).
                 However, the conditions of the license require that any work derived from
                 Beehive must be identified as such, and also be released under the GPL - i.e.,
                 you cannot sell Beehive commercially. For more information, read the text of the
                 GPL in the file called COPYING.</p>

        <h2>2. Installing Beehive and getting it to work</h2>

             <h3>2.1 Where to find installation instructions</h3>
                 <p>Installing Beehive is covered in readme.txt. It's a fairly simple process,
                 though it could be made simpler, and doubtless will be in later releases.</p>

        <hr />
        <h2>3. Technical questions</h2>

             <h3>3.1 How scalable is Beehive?</h3>
                 <p>We've found that Beehive can easily handle our forum (http://www.tehforum.co.uk/),
                 which is pretty high-traffic. The database layout is designed with efficiency in
                 mind, and we leave it up to MySQL to do all the big data-crunching. In short,
                 don't worry (provided you have enough disk space to store the database, you'll
                 be fine).</p>

             <h3>3.2 Why did you write it in PHP?</h3>
                 <p>Because PHP is the best language ever, ever. It's fast, very powerful, and free.
                 You can run Beehive without paying any software costs (use Linux, Apache, MySQL,
                 and PHP). The other, more practical reason is that we already knew it.</p>

        <hr />
        <h2>4. Other questions</h2>

             <h3>4.1 Why the fixation with bees?</h3>
                 <p>We're not really sure. The name Beehive was suggested since we wanted something
                 that reflected the forum as a community (which, after all, is what a beehive is).
                 If you're not that keen on bees, you can change the default style to one of the
                 others, and the bees will be gone. The forum owner will still be called the
                 "queen", but tough. No-one has to know that, anyway.</p>

             <h3>4.2 I hate frames. Why did you use them?</h3>
                 <p>The community which is now Teh Forum has used many different types of online
                 discussion media in its time. And this is our favourite. Sorry.</p>

        <hr />
        <h2>5. Improving Beehive</h2>

             <h3>5.1 Beehive doesn't do x Can you make it do that?</h3>
                 <p>We welcome feedback, bug reports, and requests for extra features etc. The best
                 place is to ask is probably the forum at http://beehiveforum.net/forum/. But
                 bear in mind that we do this in our spare time.</p>

                 <p>Of course, since Beehive is open source, you could always implement whatever
                 feature you want yourself. We'd love you to submit patches.</p>
