        <p>Design notes.</p>
        <p>Ok, right about now, the more sensitive of the designers are blowing
          chunks over their keyboards because of the blue and green and stripes.
          I'd like to remind people and Boughton that this is merely a testbed.
          I've added a couple of basic images so we can play around if we need
          some backgrounds, and I picked blue and green so you don't have to look
          at a grey screen. Meh.<br>
          I think that all the really basic styles the back-end designers need
          to <i>start</i> playing around are included, and therefore they can
          start messing with the page generating code. Further styles etc. will
          be added when they are needed, as will be form items, pictures for buttons
          etc. so it's not crucial at this point to worry about the colours.</p>
        <p>Images are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>messagebg.gif<br>
            The green background to this page</li>
          <li>blue.gif<br>
            Blue striped background to the folder/thread navigation frame</li>
          <li>beehive.jpg<br>
            Logo pic. Just for fun :&not;)</li>
          <li>banner.gif<br>
            The blue/green stripes in the top frame</li>
          <li>Go.jpg<br>
            The blue &quot;go&quot; button. Doesn't do anything and will probably
            be replaced. Included as a generic button sized image for use as a
            generic button image.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These will be swapped out as and when people come up with better options...</p>
        <p>Frames are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>MainFrame<br>
            This frame. The messages go here. Wooo!</li>
          <li>LeftFrame<br>
            The Folder/Trhead navigation frame. Will be resizeable.</li>
          <li>TopFrame<br>
            The frame at...the top! Will hold the logo, and any cool widgets we
            come up with. But not banner ads.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Styles are listed by Item+sub-item (e.g. the post item has sub items
          - body, head, info etc.):</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Foldername<br>
            The name of the folder. Black &quot;Smallcaps&quot; variant on a white
            background</li>
          <li>Threadname<br>
            This style provides a blue background with a 1px black border and
            2px padding.</li>
          <li>Messagefoot<br>
            Named &quot;message&quot; to avoid confusion with the &quot;post&quot;
            items. It gives a dark blue background for the footer and page navigation
            box at the bottom of MainFrame</li>
          <li>Notifier<br>
            Gray background, Green 10px font size, right float. An experimental
            item.<br>
            The idea being that this item will be updated when you refresh the
            page, either by posting or by requesting new threads, (or perhaps
            as a timed event to avoid hammering the server), and it will simply
            read &quot;N new posts to you&quot; where N is the number of new posts
            addressed to you.</li>
          <li>Postnumber<br>
            The number of the post (On delphi displayed at teh top of the message
            in the format of (xxx.2 in reply to xxx.1). Right justified, 10px
            fotn size.</li>
          <li>Postbody<br>
            Provides the white background to the posts, with left, right and bottom
            1px black border, and 2px padding to move the text away from the sides.</li>
          <li>Posthead<br>
            Provides the blue background to the head of the post. Right, left
            and top borders at 1px.<br>
            There is, annoyingly, a small gap between the cells, which I'm currently
            too tired to care about. </li>
          <li>Postinfo<br>
            Information abou the post. Displayed on delphi as<br>
            Message N of X<br>
            Date<br>
            Has a Right &quot;float&quot; value. This, combined with Posttofrom's
            left float vaue causes both items to share teh same line without the
            need to specify position either Absolutely or Relatively. Works in
            Netscape6, Opera6 and IE 6, so w00t.</li>
          <li>Posttofrom<br>
            Who the post is To and who it's From. Has a left float value.</li>
          <li>Postresponse<br>
            Sets 12px, centered, underlined text for te responce links: Reply,
            Delete, Ignore, Edit, etc. Underlining will be removed because it
            sucks.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Customised Tags</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Link<br>
            Changes link to green (doesn't fricken work)</li>
          <li>Alink<br>
            Changes active link to lurid green (doesn't fricken work)</li>

          <li>Body<br>
