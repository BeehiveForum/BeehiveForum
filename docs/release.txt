Beehive Forum Release Notes

What's new in 0.2
=================

User Selectable Styles
======================
Forum members can now select from a number of styles to
change the appearance of the forum. Pretty much everything can be styled, by
editing the CSS files and altering the images.

Polls
=====
Polls are now enabled. They let people vote, and stuff.

Attachments
===========
Forum owners can optionally enable the attachments feature, allowing members to 
upload files to the forum server. Space available per member can be limited.

Forgot password
===============
Muppets who forget their passwords can now get an e-mail to the address they 
entered, with a link where they can reset the password.

Guest access
============
Casual browsers can access forums as guests, but can not post.

Lots of little things
=====================
Little enhancements here and there that just generally make things nicer. Like 
friend icons in the message view, and multiple logins being saveable.

Discontinued undocumented features
==================================
Most of the undocumented features from 0.1 have been removed, such as the 
undocumented feature where fix_html would occasionally loop until PHP timed out,
and the famous "time-travelling" undocumented feature where post's creation times 
were updated when they were read by the user they were addressed to.

New undocumented features
=========================
It is possible that the addition of the new documented features has resulted in 
the accidental addition of new undocumented features. If you believe you have 
found an undocumented feature, please let us know in the test forum at 
http://beehiveforum.net/forum

\o/ Domain name \o/
===================
We got the domain name registered, so you can now use http://beehiveforum.net for 
all your Beehive URL needs. It's still hosted on SourceForge (http://sf.net),
lovely people that they are.
