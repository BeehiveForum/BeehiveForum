Beehive Forum Release Notes

What's new in 0.6RC1
====================

- Notes

        - BeehiveForum 0.6 introduces a new search indexing procedure
	  which will unfortunately skew the search results of your forum
	  while it catches up and performs the indexing. If you have a 
	  lot of posts this will take a long time to complete. To help
	  reduce the time required in the indexing your old posts, 
	  included is search_index.php which is suitable for running
	  from a cron or schedule job. Posts created after upgrading
	  to 0.6 will be indexed as they are created.

	- New Admin logging options require 0.6 to clear your current
	  Admin Log before upgrading. This is at the expense of
	  improved logging. If you want to keep your old logs please
	  view and save the HTML output or export the ADMIN_LOG table
	  for each forum.

- Brand new features

        - Installation can now be completed via CLI over telnet / SSH.
        - RSS Feed propagation allows the replication of an RSS feed
	  into threads on your forum. Useful for news headlines from
	  other sites to promote discussion.
	- Added constant for the include files path so that developers
	  can reuse the Beehive include files while placing their own
	  scripts outside of the main forum folder.
        - Post Approval options allows moderators to optionally approve
          posts before they are displayed to other users.
	- Email address confirmation for new user registrations.
	- Text Captcha options for new user registrations to help
	  prevent scripts and bots from creating user accounts.
        - TinyMCE WYSIWYG integration with BeehiveForum's compose pages.
	- French Canadian (fr-ca) language file. Thanks to Jo from
	  Canadian Politics Forums (http://www.canadianpolitics.com/)
	- Forums can be opened, closed, restricted or password protected
	  without requiring access to the 'Manage Forums' section. A new
	  option allows a user with access to the 'Manage Forums' section
	  to disable a forum which will hide it from the My Forums list
	  as per 0.5's behaviour.
	- WikiWiki integration allows Beehive to automatically hyperlink
	  CamalCase words as used by most popular Wiki sites.
	- Wiki-esq quick links for linking to a specific post using 
	  msg:1.1 or to user's profile using user:Logon.
	- Attachments allow for the creation of thumbnails in posts for
	  supported file types (*.png, *.jpg, *.gif). Requires GD library
	  to be compiled in with PHP.

	  posts without having to be given moderator privileges.

	  can post and perform searches.

	  Messages sections and correctly prevent access to the related
	  pages.
	- Added option to specify the forum time zone and day light saving
	  mode independently of the server clock and user time zone.
	- Added option to prevent users from ignoring admin.
	- Default New User registration settings including email notification
	  PM notification, etc. can be defined in Global Forum Settings.
	- Added <label for=""> to checkboxes and radio buttons which allow
	  for clickable text to toggle form elements.
	- Added post stats page to Admin tools which can be used to find
	  the Top 20 posters during specified period.

- Enhanced old features

        - Greatly improved Unicode UTF-8 support which should make it
	  possible to type in different alphabets in the same post.
        - Improved user permissions handling to be more consistent and
          less prone to problems. A lot of the niggles you've all
          encountered with 0.5's permissions should be fixed in 0.6.
        - Ban controls now allow banning of IP Addresses, Logons,
          Nicknames and email addresses, all by wildcard matching.
        - Better search indexing added which generates less load on MySQL
	  server when a user performs a search.
	- Better Admin log with less possibility for display of Unknown
	  User, Unknown Thread / Post, etc.
	- Added ability for Admin to change user's password.
	- Re-added User Alias list on User page, but removed IP banning
	  option as this is now handled by the new Ban Controls section.

	  more precise in matching whole words.
        - Links and Link folders are now sorted alphabetically by default.
	- Replaced Beautifier with Geshi - Generic Syntax Highlighter.
	- Improved user permissions allow for separate Links section
	  and Post moderators as well as better global Admin who
	  can optionally moderate over all forums.
	- Improved emoticons support makes it easier to create and 
	  distribute emoticon packs that are easy to install.
	- Attachments now always open in a new window / tab.
	- New improved attachments popup with G-mail-a-like multiple
	  file uploads.
	- Light mode now uses the Forum Name in the logon page to indicate
	  the name of the forum you are visiting.
	- Images to links option will now convert embedded files including
	  Shockwave and Flash files.
	- Added Logon and User UID to top of Edit Preferences page.
        - Removed all inline CSS and replaced it with class names which
	  can be more easily modified in your style sheets.
	- Greatly improved the start page editor and style sheet editor
	  with more useful error messages and help for write protected
	  files and folders.
	- Added Deleted by text and time / date stamp on deleted messages.
	- Prevented users from blocking moderators and stopping them
	  from sending them PMs.

	  said "Sent by X from a Beehive Forum"
	- Better session handling code allows users to logout correctly
	  and appear logged out on the Recent Users display.
	- Better detection for when a user's session expires, giving them
	  more control over logging back in with minimal fuss.
	- Fixed all user preference updates so they don't affect all
	  forums. Changing things like post page settings, font size, 
	  toggling stats display now only affects the forum a user is
	  currently visiting rather than all of them.
	- Re-added display of Guests to Recent Visitors list.

- Bug fixes

        - Fixed call to undefined function user_change_pw() fixed. A
          patch is also available to fix separately this problem in 0.5
	- Fixed call to undefined function gzcompress() when GZIP
	  compression was enabled on a PHP installation that was compiled
	  without ZLIB.
	- Lots of IIS server fixes.
	- Lots and lots more!

- Known issues

	- Threads created from RSS Feeds are known to have problems
	  with some characters displaying incorrectly where the
	  character encoding of the feed is different to that of
	  the output generated by the BeehiveForum software.

	- Incorrect HTML contained within RSS Feeds will be rendered
	  correctly (shown as HTML entities) due to aggressive checking
	  used by BeehiveForum to make sure broken HTML doesn't break
	  the display of the messages.

What's new in 0.5 ("What You Have Is Enough", released 10th December 2004)
=================

- Notes
        - Beehive Forum 0.5 corrected a very large scale problem with
	  stripslashes which means that content created with prior
	  versions may be subject to erroneous display once you
	  upgrade to 0.5.

- Brand new features

        - Multiple Forum support. Yes, finally you can run more than one
          forum on your web space using a single Beehive installation, under
	  a 'My Forums' linking system.
	- Forums can be open/closed/restricted/passworded.
	- Install/upgrade script simplifies installation process.
	- Comprehensive user permissions - users can be given/denied access
	  to post/read/moderate etc. in specific folders, as well as having 
	  HTML/sig privileges given/denied.
	- As well as per-folder moderators, a user can be assigned as a 
	  'Global moderator', who can moderate in all folders.
	- User groups can be created to help moderation of large forums.

	  other Beehive forums and sites easily.
        - New 'My Controls' replaces the old preferences and profile
          sections, incorporating them into a single location.
        - Emoticons. Really fancy emoticons. With per-user options to display
	  any of several graphical sets, or plain-text, or nothing at all.
	- Emoticon preview pane on post page for quick reference.
        - Users can now perform basic moderation duties on their own
          posts on the new 'Thread Options' page, including changing the thread 
	  title and moving the thread to different folders. Admins can prevent 
	  this functionality by 'edit locking' the thread to prevent it from 
	  being changed.
	- Users can access 'Thread Options' by clicking the icon to the left
	  of every thread title in the thread list frame. From here a thread can
	  be ignored without ever reading it.
	- Posts can now be marked as unread, for later reading.
	- New 'Reply as PM' link on every post will quickly create a new PM
	  addressed to the post author, with the thread title as the subject.
	- Number of PMs per user can be restricted by the admin.
	- PM auto-pruning - messages not in the 'saved' folder can be 
	  automatically deleted after a certain time has passed.
	- Option to reply a PM with the in-reply-to PM's text quoted.
        - New user option to change all images embedded into a post by users
          (inc. signature images) into clickable links.
	- 'Reply to all' allows a user to reply to an entire thread instead of
	  a specific post.
	- New tabular polls to compare votes from different poll groups.
	- Quick search.
	- Per-user word filter.
	- Beautifier (www.beautifier.org) integration with BH <code> tag.
	- <spoiler> tag to hide text which may otherwise spoil that movie
	  you're planning on seeing tonight's killer plot twist. <spoiler>He
	  was dead all along!!</spoiler>
	- <noemots> tag to prevent anything within it from being converted to
	  an emoticon.
	- New post page preferences which allow you to toggle the HTML toolbar,
	  the emoticons preview pane and the signature text field. You can also
	  choose an HTML mode by default; you can choose to enable/disable
	  emoticons in your messages by default and so on.
        - English Language Dictionary available from the HTML Toolbar which
	  can be configured to auto-check spelling each time you post.
	- Guest account no longer requires cookies, so that search engines can
	  spider Beehive forums. A robots.txt file is also included to help
	  search engines spider the right content.
	- A user can now set their default start page to be the thread list in
	  the left frame, and the forum start page in the right frame.
	- New thread_rss.php allows recent Beehive threads to be loaded into an
	  RSS reader.

	  as well as any threads they create.

- Enhanced old features

        - HTML toolbar is now present for post creation; post editing; poll
	  creation; signature editing; PM creation; PM editing; start page
	  editing. Can't get enough of that HTML toolbar.
	- Slicker HTML integration - <quote>/<code>/<spoiler> tags won't show
	  their innards, for example.
	- Better editing page. No longer will you have to toggle between a 
	  plain-text/HTML version of your post - BH will automatically 
	  approximoguesstimate what settings you originally posted your message
	  with.
	- Polls can now be 'soft-edited' - minor edits which won't reset the
	  votes.
	- Poll options can either be displayed as radio buttons (as before) or
	  as a drop-down list.
        - Improved word filter that allows you to find and replace rather than 
          obscure the filtered words with asterix.
        - Word filter can now be disable without having to clear the filter 
          list of the current entries. Useful if browsing from different places 
          such as home and work.
        - Many pages have had their output tweaked so they fit in with the 
          overall style of beehive.
        - Attachments now support the uploading of multiple files at the same 
          time. Useful for dial-up users who want to attach multiple files 
          without having to do each file in turn.
        - The forum owner can now choose to have deleted attachments still 
          show (with the link removed) in posts.
        - Alternative attachment method which allows Beehive to make use of the 
          old 0.3 and older attachment retrieval method for servers that can't 
          handle the newer method.
        - The search page has been remade with a better design and better 
	  functionality.
	- 'Page [1] 2 3 ...' on various pages rewritten a bit posher.

- Fixes
        - Lots and lots!

- Known Issues

        - Content created prior to the installation of 0.5 will be incorrectly
          escaped (all ' and " characters will appear as \' and \" respectively).
          This is due to a major bug in versions prior to 0.5 which meant
          content inserted into the database was double-escaped.



What's new in 0.4 ("In The Flesh", released 10th December 2003)
=================

- Brand new features
        - Personal Messages allow users to keep more private matters out of
	  view from the rest of the forum members.

	- Attachments can no longer be embedded in posts, making them more
	  narrowband friendly, more secure and less bandwidth hungry.
	- New cookie domain setting allows Beehive to set it's cookies so
	  that they will work across all sub-domains of a web site.
	- Users can now choose to display their age and/or birthday in both 
	  their profile pop-up and also on the Start page.

	  users from posting polls / posts in them.

	  actually contain some posts.
	- User custom selected font size now applies to all on-screen
	  fonts. Smaller fonts are automatically scaled to the main
	  font size used.
	- Some layout changes make Beehive look better on non MSIE
	  based web browsers.

- Known Issues

        - Folders created under 0.3 or below which contained quotes will now
          display incorrectly in 0.4. You can fix this by visiting the admin
          folders option and fixing the folder names. This was due to a bug
          in previous versions which has now been fixed.

What's new in 0.3.1 ("Beemused", released 3rd September 2003)
===================

- New features / Enhancements
        - There are no new features or enhancements in this release.
          This release is primarily intended to fix some problems that
          exist in MySQL 4.0.13 and higher. Don't worry 0.4 will be
          coming soon!

- Fixes
        - Users lost access to restricted folders if they ignored them

          soldier if he/she changed her own permissions through the
          Admin Users interface.
        - It was not possible to delete Profile Items and when deleting

          interest settings under MySQL 4.0.13 and later

What's new in 0.3 ("A little Beehind", released 11th February 2003)
=================

- Brand new features
        - All output is now optionally gzip encoded to save bandwidth.
        - The styles system has changed a bit - the majority of the stylesheet
          is now static, which saves even more bandwidth.
        - You can modify the start page directly from the admin interface.
        - As well as ignoring a user, you can make them your "Friend", and
          filter the thread list to only show discussions started by Friends if
          you want.
        - New poll system, with up to 20 options per poll.
        - There's a new frame-less light HTML "diet" version of the forum - now
          you can browse and post from a PDA and some mobile phones.
        - A links section that allows your users to create a database of useful
          links.
        - You can see a list of possible aliases for any user (people who have

        - Banning a user by IP address is now possible.
        - Option to delete all of a user's posts in the admin interface.
        - You can now ignore entire folders.

        - Various new UI stuff - friend / attachment icons in the thread list,
          link back to the voting form in a poll thread, etc.
        - Polls are now slightly more anonymous (at least, it's not trivial for
          someone with database access to see how you voted, but neither is it
          secure).
        - Users can choose to be directed straight to the forum (bypassing the
          start page) when logging in.
        - The time a user last logged on and the total number of posts they have
          made on the forum are displayed in their profile.
        - You can now ignore only someone's signature, or globally ignore all
          signatures if you want.
        - Mark as Read has more options (all discussions, visible discussions,
          next 50 discussions)

- Fixes

          errors/warnings/notices at all.
        - Various fixes to make things work properly with Microsoft-IIS.

        - Database errors are now caught in a nice way.
        - Some session handling improvements

What's new in 0.2 ("Let It Bee", released 12th September 2002)
=================

- User Selectable Styles: Forum members can now select from a number of styles
to change the appearance of the forum. Pretty much everything can be styled, by
editing the CSS files and altering the images.

- Polls: Polls are now enabled. They let people vote, and stuff.

- Attachments: Forum owners can optionally enable the attachments feature,
allowing members to upload files to the forum server. Space available per member
can be limited.

- Forgot password: Muppets who forget their passwords can now get an e-mail to
the address they entered, with a link where they can reset the password.

- Guest access: Casual browsers can access forums as guests, but can not post.

- Lots of little things: Little enhancements here and there that just generally
make things nicer. Like friend icons in the message view, and multiple logins
being saveable.

- Discontinued undocumented features: Most of the undocumented features from 0.1
have been removed, such as the undocumented feature where fix_html would
occasionally loop until PHP timed out, and the famous "time-travelling"
undocumented feature where post's creation times were updated when they were
read by the user they were addressed to.

- New undocumented features: It is possible that the addition of the new 
documented features has resulted in the accidental addition of new undocumented
features. If you believe you have found an undocumented feature, please let us
know in the test forum at http://beehiveforum.net/forum

- \o/ Domain name \o/: We got the domain name registered, so you can now use
http://beehiveforum.net for all your Beehive URL needs. It's still hosted on
SourceForge (http://sf.net), lovely people that they are.
