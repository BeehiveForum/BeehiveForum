Beehive Forum Release Notes

What's new in 0.7 (Released 1st October 2006)
=================

- Notes

        - BeehiveForum 0.7 introduces a new thread unread cut-off
          that helps to increase performance by storing unread
          thread data for a limited time rather than in previous
          builds where it was stored indefinitely. You can set up
          the thread unread cut-off in the Global Forum Settings
          portion of your Beehive Forum installation but pruning
          of the USER_THREAD tables must be performed by hand.

- Changes from 0.6.3

        - Fixed: My Forums showing lots of unread messages because
                 it wasn't using the cut-off code.
        - Fixed: Light mode logon form wasn't redirecting correctly
                 if you had a msg= or folder= url query.
        - Fixed: Extra unneeded ban check in admin.php
        - Fixed: Homepage URL and Pic URL were not optional and you
                 couldn't delete the data in them if you wanted to.
        - Fixed: Homepage URL never showing up on user profile
                 popup.
        - Fixed: USER_PERM_BANNED wasn't always working correctly.
                 Moved check into main files and out of bh_session_init().
        - Fixed: Installer and upgrade scripts now attempt to
                 recreate all the indexes that Beehive has ever had.
        - Fixed: Erranous word filter tags on email notifications
                 caused by format_user_name using add_wordfilter_tags
                 rather than straight apply_wordfilter.
        - Fixed: Added missing log entries for deleting RSS Feeds
                 and updating Bans to admin_viewlog.php
        - Fixed: Potential conflict with RSS feed updates containing
                 the same full story URL.

                 key and not remove any keys after that in the list
        - Fixed: upgrade-06x-to-07.php now works on all 0.6.x
                 builds including release candidates without complaining
                 about conflicts.

        - Fixed: Error handler not always able to get the MySQL
                 version number so now we don't try to display what we
                 can't get.
        - Fixed: Error in installer when target database doesn't
                 exist.

                 FireFox Javascript console fixed.

                 configurable option.
        - Added: Check for Windows CE powered Smartphones that shows

                 list and recover it back.

                 html files (1 for each message) and includes your
                 attachments and your user style. No emoticons because it
                 wouldn't make sense to include all the files! Coming soon
                 some options in My Controls to specify what gets exported.

                 clickable links to their home pages.

        - Added: Output for user time tracking to profile popup.
        - Added: Filename to end of get_attachment.php links to try

                 (appends ?[modifiedtime] to end of URL)
        - Added: Backend code for post view counter. No idea where
                 to display it at the moment. Bottom left of each post?

                 data based on the settings picked in Default Forum
                 settings.
        - Added: bh_update_user_time() function which handles the
                 USER_TIME updates.
        - Added: USER_TIME update it performed once for each user
                 every time their session needs renewing.
        - Added: FULLTEXT index added to SEARCH_ENGINE_BOTS to speed
                 up matching.
        - Added: Query to attempt conversion of SESSIONS table to
                 HEAP if available.
        - Added: Upgrade scripts now calculate and insert the thread
                 view counts. It's only 1 thread view per registered user
                 and doesn't count guests or multiple views but it's a
                 start at least :)


        - Changed: Tehforum address changed to co.uk as the .net
                   domain has expired and is being held to ransom.

        - Changed: Got rid of the index creating loops in the
                   installers because they're too slow.
        - Changed: Removed a lot of indexes that were causing slow
                   downs just to conflicts (?) with primary keys.
        - Changed: Moved the current user perm checks into the
                   session array so that there are fewer hits on the
                   database.
        - Changed: Error message and success messages on
                   admin_banned and admin_rss_feeds now appear for more

                   mostly) layout.
        - Changed: Updated x-hacker language file.
        - Changed: Logon and logout forms tidied up a bit.
        - Changed: Wording in admin_default_forum_settings for

        - Changed: Seperated bh_session_init() into two functions
                   with the second new one handling the guest session
                   creation.
        - Changed: New RSS Feed Admin panel with easier to
                   understand form and options.
        - Changed: RSS Feed Prefix is now optional and if used
                   doesn't include square brackets around it.

        - Changed: Clicking reset nickname button in
                   edit_relations saves that relationship but not others.
        - Changed: admin_forums,php width added to main table to
                   prevent it looking bunched up.
        - Changed: Shrunk logon form slightly to make it look less
                   gash.
        - Changed: Word filter is now done in output buffering
                   rather than load list and call mutiple times everytime

        - Changed: Removed function
                   messages_get_most_recent_unread function and updated 
                   messages_get_most_recent function to find both read and
                   unread messages.
        - Changed: admin_post_approve.php, delete.php and edit.php

        - Changed: Function thread_get() now checks to see which
                   folders the user can view.
        - Changed: All calls to thread_get placed within if
                   statements to check the return value for above change.
        - Changed: Removed useless calls to thread_get_title,
                   thread_get_folder, etc which were being duplicated by
                   calls to thread_get.
        - Changed: Removed join with THREAD table for
                   message_display. Instead we use the data we alread
                   fetched from thread_get.
        - Changed: My Controls pages layouts changed to move text
                   away from the table border.

                   basic SELECT ... LIMIT 0, 1 style query.

        - Changed: Updated fr-ca language.
        - Changed: The individual light mode scripts now check to
                   see if you have a saved logon cookie and redirect you if
                   you're not logged in.
        - Changed: Replaced UTC time zones with GMT + country
                   names

        - Changed: Removed redudant final_uri code from light mode
                   as it doesn't do anything at the moment. Will work out a
                   better way to handle it some time, but for now the frame
                   set and the <noframes> tags and the whole redirecting
                   causes too many headaches.
        - Changed: Removed lforums.php from robots.txt so that
                   Google and co can index multiple forums under a single
                   BH install.
        - Changed: Less Resource Intensive way of updating
                   THREAD_STATS table UNREAD_PID, UNREAD_CREATED columns.
        - Changed: Lack of LAST_READ data is now calculated as
                   threads are viewed and as the USER_THREAD data is pruned
                   rather than working it out on the fly with a join
                   against the POST table.
        - Changed: Updated en-us and x-hacker language files.
        - Changed: Moved the invalid username / password prompt in
                   logon.php to be within the frameset (uses a cookie to
                   check if the logon was a failure)
        - Changed: Gave the Light mode the same functionality as
                   the full thread list with the ability to mark a single
                   folder as read.
        - Changed: Fixed spelling error "Where moved to" in
                   en.inc.php
        - Changed: New CSS class for thread_tracking_notice rather
                   than reusing text_captcha_error
        - Changed: Deleted threads can now be browsed by
                   Moderators. Edit Thread Options link at bottom of page
                   links to thread_options.php to allow undelete.
        - Changed: Installer updated to reflect changes to
                   USER_PREFS table and USER_TRACK table.
        - Changed: Removed Reply To links from PM Inbox export.
        - Changed: UTF-8 encoded files.
        - Changed: Removed redundant check from thread_list.php
                   which is now handled by thread_get()
        - Changed: Funky queries for mark as read which literally
                   take 2 to 3 seconds on default MySQl installation with
                   no tuning! Not sure if these will work with MySQL 3.x.
                   They should do because the manual mentions the method is
                   available. Anyone want to test?
        - Changed: Reduced number of queries required to find
                   threads with attachments for display of paperclip in
                   thread list.
        - Changed: X-Hacker language doesn't show matching strings
                   anymore like en-us.
        - Changed: Removed useless joins against GROUP_USER and
                   GROUP_PERM tables from query in user_logon function.
        - Changed: Probability of forum clean up functions running
                   has been increased by default from 1 in 50 to 1 in 20
        - Changed: Only one forum clean up function is run per
                   page load per user if they run at all. Prevents them
                   running all at once and causing long page loads.
        - Changed: Removed POST table reindexes from upgrade and
                   installer after running tests on Teh Forum.
        - Changed: All the wasteful SELECT COUNT queries have been
                   changed to basic queries that fetch 1 row (LIMIT 0, 1)
                   and 1 column (primary key)
        - Changed: PM export HTML now uses verbose date format to
                   include day month and year.
        - Changed: Mucho faster emoticon class. Shaved over 400ms
                   off the execution time (woo!)
        - Changed: new-install.php small change to prevent
                   unneccesary processing after removal of conflicts.
        - Changed: bh_session_get_perms_by_folder() is more
                   efficient.
        - Changed: Moved test for USER_PERM_GUEST_ACCESS into
                   folder.inc.php.
        - Changed: folder_get_all() and folder_get_all_by_forum()
                   now use the session data rather than requery the
                   database.
        - Changed: Converted all BIT_OR SQL calls for selecting or
                   retrieving folders to the new bh_session_check_perm()
                   function.
        - Changed: Moved VIEWED column from THREAD table into a
                   seperate THREAD_STATS table.
        - Changed: USER_TRACK table now records both the user's
                   longest single session and their total session time.
        - Changed: Javascript threaded 'hack' to make the PM
                   notification appear without disrupting the page loading.
        - Changed: Pluralisation of 'You have %d new PM" so we
                   correctly get "You have 1 new PM" and "You have 2 new
                   PMs"
        - Changed: Post count now is Thread count. Makes more
                   sense. Duh.
        - Changed: bh_session_end() now uses current time rather
                   than the session time.
        - Changed: Option to reset user permissions doesn't affect
                   the user's moderation permission anymore.
        - Changed: USER_POLL_VOTES table structure changed to work
                   on the primary key to make queries faster.
        - Changed: Probability code for update_stats(),
                   thread_auto_prune_unread_data(),
                   bh_remove_stale_sessions() and pm_system_prune_folders()
                   now used mt_rand() rather than time() which means the
                   functions are less likely to fire when two users load a
                   page within milliseconds of each other.
        - Changed: PM Pruning, Stats Updating and Session Expiring
                   code now all use the same probability before processing
                   rather than every 15 minutes.
        - Changed: Thread pruning now uses a slightly higher
                   probability as it wasn't ever firing on Teh Forum.
        - Changed: bh_user_update_time() function to use less
                   queries.
        - Changed: POST_ATTACHMENT_FILES table format changed
        - Changed: Switched join on thread and pm has_attachment
                   functions to make better use of the primary keys on

        - Changed: Removed join on THREAD table from poll display.
        - Changed: Removed KEYWORDS column from SEARCH_RESULTS
                   table and moved data to LAST_SEARCH_KEYWORDS in
                   USER_TRACK.
        - Changed: Call me nuts if you want but I've changed
                   referrer back to referer. Spelt wrongly but correctly
                   according to HTTP specification.
        - Changed: Limited bh_delete_expired_sessions to 10 at a
                   time to prevent the user who gets lumbered with the
                   delete from waiting for the page to load.
        - Changed: User session length tracking now works for
                   users who have browse anonymously switched on.
        - Changed: Removed WHERE from query that updates
                   UNREAD_PID and UNREAD_CREATED columns so they always get
                   updated!
        - Changed: Prevented guests from spoofing the thread list
                   to get it to load thread types they can't view.
        - Changed: Added checks for guests and use shorter less
                   complex queries with no relationships, interest or
                   unread data.
        - Changed: Unread thread views limited to a maximum cut
                   off period allows USER_THREAD table to be pruned.
        - Changed: Updated English and German languages.
        - Changed: Updated en-us and x-hacker language files.
                   fr-ca and de to come soon.
        - Changed: bh_check_languages now orders the problems it
                   finds so it groups together missing strings,
                   untranslated, unneeded, etc.
        - Changed: More comprehensive bh_check_languages.php
                   script which can selectively turn on or off checking for
                   untranslated strings.
        - Changed: bh_ms_word_spelling_check.php now writes the
                   changes to en-new.inc.php rather than requiring you to
                   do the changes manually.
        - Changed: Updated fr-ca translation.
        - Changed: Format of table key arrays changed so we can
                   create named indexes so we don't create duplicate
                   indexes on tables.
        - Removed: UTF-8 Page encoding. No idea how to fix the RSS
                   output. Might just give in and flag it as a known issue.
        - Removed: Guest Auto logon optionas it doesn't work with
                   the new session code where everybody is a guest even if
                   they have a saved logon.
        - Removed: Unused logon error URL query when invalid
                   username and password.
        - Removed: Useless call to thread_can_view which was
                   pretty much duplicating the query in thread_get.
        - Removed: thread_can_view function removed from
                   thread.inc.php.
        - Removed: Undone the changes in the previous commit to
                   the PM and thread have_attachments functions.
        - Removed: CGI installer because it didn't work and was
                   never maintained and was unsupported. Sorry peeps.


What's new in 0.6.3 (Released 12th February 2006)
===================

- Notes

        - BeehiveForum 0.6.3 fixed a few issues highlighted within
          the release of 0.6.2. For more detailed
          features of 0.6.2 please see the 0.6 release notes.

- Changes from 0.6.2

        - Fixed: html_draw_top() and html_draw_bottom() are now used for the
                 frames pages (admin.php, discussion.php, index.php, start.php and
                 user.php) so we correctly add the forum description and RSS feed
                 links rather than the generic Beehive ones.
        - Fixed: Second attempt at fixing the error when updating your user
                 prefs. Not even sure that the first patch didn't fix it to be
                 honest.
        - Fixed: Added some code to disable register_globals to prevent an
                 exploit involving passing values in the URL
        - Fixed: Links pages weren't filtering the input correctly and were
                 allowing HTML to be posted.
        - Fixed: potential exploit made available though page url var in
                 admin.php
        - Fixed: Prevented the use of a hyphen in the forum webtag because it
                 breaks things.
        - Fixed: Not being able to access restricted forum when access is
                 applied correctly to user account.
        - Fixed: Clicking Change password / permissions button took you to the
                 permissions page for the wrong forum.
        - Fixed: Removed align="middle" from images on all pages because they
                 look out of place in the newer Gecko engine builds (FireFox 1.5)
        - Fixed: Thread list "there are no messages in this mode" text eas
                 stuck to the bottom of the drop down in newer Gecko engine builds
                 (FireFox 1.5)
        - Fixed: Missing html_draw_top() calls in edit_signature.php when
                 there is an error and also changed basetarget to _blank so that when
                 previewing signature any links open in new window/tab without the
                 HTML needing a target attribute.
        - Fixed: Added tests for perm_forumtools_access() on post data so
                 people can't send post data to change the user's nickname / password
                 when they don't have access to it.
        - Fixed: forum settings array is constructed using only two queries
                 now instead of 2 for current forum and another for global settings.
        - Fixed: Bug in admin_user.php could allow user to loose access to
                 Admin section on individual forums. Global perms were not affected
                 by this bug.
        - Fixed: form_quick_button() wasn't looking at the right variable when
                 you send it an array of var names and values
        - Fixed: Inconsistency in dictionary caused "(no suggestions)" to show
                 when the dictionary had finished checking all words.
        - Fixed: Insert error when processing user post count when viewing a
                 new user's (no posts) profile.
        - Fixed: Dictionary now works much better. It correctly matches words
                 like couldn't, wouldn't and words in single quotes, it skips URLs,
                 email address and HTML and doesn't corrupt unicode characters what
                 so ever. It also correctly informs the user if there was no match in
                 the dictionary instead of skiping over the word.
        - Fixed: Unicode characters were being corrupted by Javascript when
                 sending the text back after using the dictionary.
        - Fixed: Emoticons and signature boxes couldn't be reshown once hidden
                 on post, edit and pm_write pages but reloading them made them show
                 again.
        - Fixed: edit_attachments.php was showing "Other attachments" in My
                 Controls when it shouldn't.
        - Fixed: Removed debug code from forums.php
        - Fixed: Query being executed twice in when fetching forum list for
                 'My Forums' and potentially undefined variable causing error.
        - Fixed: user_stats.php no longer fetches the user prefs because it is
                 told what to do by messages.php
        - Fixed: Undefined variable $install_cgi_mode when using the web
                 interface to install.
        - Fixed: Attachment view count was incremented each time a thumbnail
                 of an image was seen.
        - Fixed: load_language_file not working sometimes because of
                 include_once being used rather than include
        - Fixed: 404 page not found error when you click Continue upon
                 finishing the install because you've just deleted install.php.
        - Fixed: Table structure for LINKS_FOLDER had been mangled and was no
                 longer allowing NULL on PARENT_FID
        - Fixed: new-install.php no longer creates the old SEARCH_KEYWORDS,
                 SEARCH_POSTS and SEARCH_MATCH tables.
        - Fixed: wordwrap plan didn't work because it seems to trim lines it
                 wraps on some OSes and not others?
        - Added: html_draw_top() now accepts a body_tag argument which stops
                 the function from drawing the body tag, as used in the frames pages.
        - Added: Favourites checkbox and button to Guest MyForums with an
                 error about needing to login.
        - Added: Probability test to see if we should clean the stale user
                 sessions. Defaults to 10% probability.
        - Added: Error out when ever the user's search query is affected by
                 the MySQL full-text stop words
        - Added: User stats differentiates between you (shown in bold), other
                 users and your friends (shown in italic) and includes tooltips which
                 tell you that you are Invisible or not.
        - Added: By request search now tells you which words were invalid in
                 your search query.
        - Added: Relevance to searches. BH doesn't do anything with it, but I
                 might sneak something in before 0.6.2
        - Added: Drop down added to search results to allow quick switching of
                 order and removed it from the actual search query.
        - Added: Post count caching to USER_TRACK table to reduce the load
                 caused by someone opening a user profile.
        - Changed: user_font.php no longer loads the user's prefs as that
                   part is handled by messages.php.
        - Changed: Made 06x upgrade script drop the SEARCH_RESULTS table
                   before attempting to create it.
        - Changed: Slight change to word wrapping in thread list and start
                   page.
        - Changed: All pages now use our DTD. Can't get the W3 validator to
                   see it though, but FireFox reports it is in Standards Compliance
                   mode. Hmm.
        - Changed: bh_check_languages.php can now help to find strings which
                   haven't been translated.
        - Changed: Removed call to threads_any_unread() in discussion.php,
                   admin_post_approve.php, delete.php and edit.php
        - Changed: Only users who are perm_forumtools_access() can change
                   another user's nickname and password.
        - Changed: bh_session_remove_stale() is now only called when the
                   user's session is about to expire.
        - Changed: Removed and / or based drop down from search and allow
                   users to compose their own boolean searches.
        - Changed: Kick button is now available to global admins rather than
                   just forum tools users
        - Changed: Dictionary is now case insensitive and with new primary
                   key much quicker.
        - Changed: Removed count() query from thread_has_attachments and
                   simply made it fetch the AID of the attachment
        - Changed: Removed count() query from thread_any_unread and made it
                   fetch the TID.PID of the thread instead.
        - Changed: Encoding on some files changed to UTF-8 PC line endings
        - Changed: emoticon_get_sets() to have an optional function argument
                   that hides the none and text emoticons
        - Changed: Attachments now sort alphabetically. Previously updating
                   the attachment to say how many times it has viewed bumped it to
                   the top of the list causing confusion when people pointed towards
                   "attachment #1" rather than naming them by filename.
        - Changed: More tweaks to search which makes things a heck of a lot
                   quicker!
        - Changed: Finding an old post to index is more friendly to the
                   server hopefully.
        - Changed: Removed use of function _in_array() as defined in
                   format.inc.php because it takes too long to process anything.
        - Changed: Updated language files.
        - Changed: Guests no longer help to index posts to help reduce load
                   on server.
        - Changed: thread_list.php and start_left.php now wordwrap thread
                   titles so they don't cause a horizontal scrollbar in the frame.
        - Changed: upgrade-06RC-to-06.php replaced with a generic script
                   which will upgrade all 0.6 releases thus far to 0.6.2.
        - Changed: upgrade-05-to-06.php replaced with upgrade-05-to-062.php.
        - Changed: start_form != start_from.
        - Changed: robots.txt. 1st stage of Google Friendly Beehive.
        - Changed: Search now checks to see if it is running MySQL 4 and if
                   so allows a choice between AND and OR based searches
        - Changed: Guests can no longer perform searches
        - Changed: Different way to check for results from user search which
                   should be less server intensive.
        - Changed: Few more changes to the start_main.php example script.
        - Changed: Removed gmmktime() and changed back to mktime() so we use
                   the server timezone.
        - Changed: Removed all the search indexing code because it was a bad
                   experiment that didn't work out. Going to concentrate of
                   optimising BH to use MySQL FULLTEXT searches instead.
        - Changed: _htmlentities now leaves single-quotes alone so they
                   won't get mangled in the database.
        - Changed: search_index.php now says which post it has just indexed.
        - Removed: search_min_word_length setting as BH now uses the MySQL
                   defaults (for MySQL < 4.0 the values are fixed at 4 and 84)
        - Removed: Text at bottom of search dialog is no longer relevant
                   because BH now errors out instead.

        - Fixed: Thread list "there are no messages in this mode" text eas stuck to the
                 bottom of the drop down in newer Gecko engine builds (FireFox 1.5)
        - Fixed: Missing html_draw_top() calls in edit_signature.php when there is an error
                 and also changed basetarget to _blank so that when previewing signature any
                 links open in new window/tab without the HTML needing a target attribute.

        - Fixed: Missing / undefined language strings in various files.

                 access to it.
        - Fixed: Double escaped $forum_name when adding a new forum.

                 posts) profile.
        - Fixed: Dictionary now works much better. It correctly matches words like couldn't,
                 wouldn't and words in single quotes, it skips URLs, email address and HTML
                 and doesn't corrupt unicode characters what so ever. It also correctly
                 informs the user if there was no match in the dictionary instead of skiping
                 over the word.
        - Fixed: Unicode characters were being corrupted by Javascript when sending the text
                 back after using the dictionary.

                 OSes and not others?

        - Fixed: attachments owned by a moderator / admin were being logged in the admin log

        - Fixed: Bug in attachments when thumbnail could not be read (i.e. corrupted file,
                 permissions error, locked file, etc).
        - Fixed: Stream lined the number fo queries that $dictionary->word_get_suggestions()
                 makes by checking that the word we're checking is well formed first.

                 and again by the RSS feed checker
        - Fixed: Added an @ on line 153 of forum.inc.php to suppress warning when no default
                 forum and no ?webtag in querystring. This might be a dirty way to fix it,
                 but i can't see why it'd break anything?
        - Fixed: Uploading a 0 byte startpage causes the admin script to always fail there
                 after.
        - Fixed: Searching using AND based search was returning no results!
        - Fixed: Double frequency time being applied to post restriction.
        - Fixed: Problem with MySQL server being in different timezone to Apache resulted in
                 post and search frequency never allowing a user to post/search or
                 post/search more frequently than they should.
        - Fixed: POST_COUNT column was being updated twice when a user posted for the very
                 first time.
        - Fixed: check_post_frequency() and search_check_frequency() were both breaking if
                 the server time changed to be behind the user's last post. Both functions
                 now check to see if the frequency is set to 0 (disabled) before checking.
        - Fixed: search.inc.php couple of bugs in new frequency test code - line 621
                 incorrect var name $minimum_post_frequency, assumed it should be
                 $search_min_frequency, changed. Similarly, line 630, $last_search_check,
                 assumed it should be $last_search_stamp, changed.
        - Fixed: Removed debugging code (oops!) and fixed missing semi-colon from query
                 resulting in error.
        - Fixed: Relevance wasn't being calculated correctly due to missing IN BOOLEAN MODE
                 in SELECT.

        - Added: User stats differentiates between you (shown in bold), other users and your

                 Invisible or not.

        - Added: Link to stop words list on search form.
        - Added: "Search Results" selection to thread list drop down.

                 something in before 0.6.2
        - Added: Drop down added to search results to allow quick switching of order and
                 removed it from the actual search query.
        - Added: english.dic didn't have I'm in it and lots of people had added it on Teh...

                 it has no negative effect either.
        - Added: Made Beehive check the arv array for a webtag so you can now call BH's
                 scripts from the CLI (webtag must be 1st arg!)
        - Added: Post count caching to USER_TRACK table to reduce the load caused by someone
                 opening a user profile.
        - Added: Missing xhtml-lat1.ent, xhtml-special.ent, xhtml-symbol.ent to CVS. Don't
                 really know if I should be including this or if I can reference them in the
                 HTML. Anyone know?

        - Removed: RSS error handler
        - Removed: Debugging code from dictionary.

        - Removed: Unneeded install_* classes from the provided stylesheets.
        - Removed: Copy of put_per_forum_custom_styles_in_here


What's new in 0.6.1 (Released 22nd Aug 2005)
===================

- Notes

        - BeehiveForum 0.6.1 fixes a few issues highlighted within
          the final release of 0.6. There are no functional changes
          to the software at this time. For more detailed features
          of 0.6.1 please see the 0.6 release notes.

- Changes from 0.6

        - Fixed: Forum level admins were able to remove the global
                 privilleges of another user without having global 
                 forum privilleges themselves.

        - Fixed: Upgrading from 0.5 to 0.6 sometimes results in an
                 error with primary keys on SEARCH_POST table.

        - Fixed: Buffer error occured when using MSIE browser and
                 being forced to download the config.inc.php when
                 installing Beehive.

        - Fixed: Forum shown was always the default forum even if the
                 webtag was valid.

        - Fixed: My Forums page would not display the message count on
                 the forum if the forum had no messages or the user
                 had not previously visited the forum.

        - Fixed: Missing SEARCH_RESULTS table when performing a new
                 installation of BeehiveForum 0.6 or upgrading from
                 a 0.5 installation.
        
        - Fixed: Missing FORUM column in SEARCH_RESULTS table when
                 upgrading from 0.6RC1 / RC2 to 0.6 final.


What's new in 0.6 ("Honey Lingers", released 18th Aug 2005)
=================

- Notes

        - BeehiveForum 0.6 introduces a new search indexing procedure
          which will unfortunately skew the search results of your forum
          while it catches up and performs the indexing. If you have a 
          lot of posts this will take a long time to complete. To help
          reduce the time required in the indexing your old posts, 
          included is search_index.php which is suitable for running
          from a cron or schedule job. Posts created after upgrading
          to 0.6 will be indexed as they are created.

        - New Admin logging options require 0.6 to clear your current
          Admin Log before upgrading. This is at the expense of
          improved logging. If you want to keep your old logs please
          view and save the HTML output or export the ADMIN_LOG table
          for each forum.

- Brand new features

        - Installation can now be completed via CLI over telnet / SSH.
        - RSS Feed propagation allows the replication of an RSS feed
          into threads on your forum. Useful for news headlines from
          other sites to promote discussion.
        - Added constant for the include files path so that developers
          can reuse the Beehive include files while placing their own
          scripts outside of the main forum folder.
        - Post Approval options allows moderators to optionally approve
          posts before they are displayed to other users.
        - Email address confirmation for new user registrations.
        - Text Captcha options for new user registrations to help
          prevent scripts and bots from creating user accounts.
        - TinyMCE WYSIWYG integration with BeehiveForum's compose
          pages.
        - French Canadian (fr-ca) language file. Thanks to Jo from
          Canadian Politics Forums (http://www.canadian-politics.com/)
        - Forums can be opened, closed, restricted or password protected
          without requiring access to the 'Manage Forums' section. A new
          option allows a user with access to the 'Manage Forums' section
          to disable a forum which will hide it from the My Forums list
          as per 0.5's behaviour.
        - WikiWiki integration allows Beehive to automatically hyperlink
          CamalCase words as used by most popular Wiki sites.
        - Wiki-esq quick links for linking to a specific post using 
          msg:1.1 or to user's profile using user:Logon.
        - Attachments allow for the creation of thumbnails in posts for
          supported file types (*.png, *.jpg, *.gif). Requires GD library
          to be compiled in with PHP.
        - New option allows all other users to edit a PILLORIED users
          posts without having to be given moderator privileges.
        - Added user tracking and limitations to restrict how often users
          can post and perform searches.
        - New User Registrations can now be disabled.
        - Added option to prevent spidering of forums by adding the
          appropriate noindex,nofollow meta tags to the HTML generated
          by Beehive.
        - Added options to enable or disable the links and Personal
          Messages sections and correctly prevent access to the related
          pages.
        - Added option to specify the forum time zone and day light saving
          mode independently of the server clock and user time zone.
        - Added option to prevent users from ignoring admin.
        - Default New User registration settings including email notification
          PM notification, etc. can be defined in Global Forum Settings.
        - Added <label for=""> to checkboxes and radio buttons which allow
          for clickable text to toggle form elements.
        - Added post stats page to Admin tools which can be used to find
          the Top 20 posters during specified period.

- Enhanced old features

        - Greatly improved Unicode UTF-8 support which should make it
          possible to type in different alphabets in the same post.
        - Improved user permissions handling to be more consistent and
          less prone to problems. A lot of the niggles you've all
          encountered with 0.5's permissions should be fixed in 0.6.
        - Ban controls now allow banning of IP Addresses, Logons,
          Nicknames and email addresses, all by wildcard matching.
        - Better search indexing added which generates less load on
          MySQL
          server when a user performs a search.
        - Better Admin log with less possibility for display of Unknown
          User, Unknown Thread / Post, etc.
        - Added ability for Admin to change user's password.
        - Re-added User Alias list on User page, but removed IP banning
          option as this is now handled by the new Ban Controls section.
        - Dictionary now skips HTML tags and entities and is otherwise
          more precise in matching whole words.
        - Links and Link folders are now sorted alphabetically by
          default.
        - Replaced Beautifier with Geshi - Generic Syntax Highlighter.
        - Improved user permissions allow for separate Links section
          and Post moderators as well as better global Admin who
          can optionally moderate over all forums.
        - Improved emoticons support makes it easier to create and 
          distribute emoticon packs that are easy to install.
        - Attachments now always open in a new window / tab.
        - New improved attachments popup with G-mail-a-like multiple

          the name of the forum you are visiting.
        - Images to links option will now convert embedded files including
          Shockwave and Flash files.
        - Added Logon and User UID to top of Edit Preferences page.
        - Removed all inline CSS and replaced it with class names which
          can be more easily modified in your style sheets.
        - Greatly improved the start page editor and style sheet editor
          with more useful error messages and help for write protected
          files and folders.
        - Added Deleted by text and time / date stamp on deleted messages.
        - Prevented users from blocking moderators and stopping them
          from sending them PMs.
        - Fixed sending an email to a user via their profile always
          said "Sent by X from a Beehive Forum"
        - Better session handling code allows users to logout correctly
          and appear logged out on the Recent Users display.
        - Better detection for when a user's session expires, giving them
          more control over logging back in with minimal fuss.
        - Fixed all user preference updates so they don't affect all
          forums. Changing things like post page settings, font size, 
          toggling stats display now only affects the forum a user is
          currently visiting rather than all of them.
        - Re-added display of Guests to Recent Visitors list.

- General Bug fixes

        - Fixed call to undefined function user_change_pw() fixed. A
          patch is also available to fix separately this problem in 0.5
        - Fixed call to undefined function gzcompress() when GZIP
          compression was enabled on a PHP installation that was compiled
          without ZLIB.
        - Lots of IIS server fixes.
        - Lots and lots more!

- Known issues

        - Threads created from RSS Feeds are known to have problems
          with some characters displaying incorrectly where the
          character encoding of the feed is different to that of
          the output generated by the BeehiveForum software.

        - Incorrect HTML contained within RSS Feeds will be rendered
          correctly (shown as HTML entities) due to aggressive checking
          used by BeehiveForum to make sure broken HTML doesn't break
          the display of the messages.

- Changes from 0.6RC2

        - Added: 4th table to search (SEARCH_RESULTS) which stores a 
                 users search results for quicker retrieval across

        - Changed: Optimised the visible discussions mark as read so

                   have to query to fetch them.
        - Changed: edit_prefs.php so it keeps the entered user data

        - Changed: Added functions to get a forum's WEBTAG and table
                   prefix. Works the same as get_table_prefix but takes
                   a forum id and queries the table rather than using
                   the webtag URI query.
        - Changed: Users with forum tools permissions can access
                   password protected forums without entering a
                   password.


- Changes from 0.6RC1

        - Fixed: error handler falling over itself if the $_POST
                 variables contains an array. Handled by a function in
                 form.inc.php that can be used by other scripts if
                 required.
        - Fixed: error in get_request_uri which trips over $_GET
                 variable containing an array. Handled by a seperate
                 function to the one in form.inc.php as this one is
                 required to construct a URL query from them.
        - Fixed: post content preview was being chopped incorrectly in
                 search results
        - Fixed: search was not working as expected when a user
                 searched for words by a user and the word was in the
                 MySQL stop list.
        - Fixed: redid all the transparency on all the Default style
                 images and made sure they were 15x15 pixels.
        - Fixed: Several changes to make Beehive more friendly to
                 non-english translations.
        - Fixed: attachments being deleted prevents moderators from
                 gaining access to the edit attachments page of a post
                 for another user.
        - Fixed: Made all edit pages check for and create an AID record
                 in the relevant ATTACHMENTS table in order to prevent
                 replacing it and loosing link between posts and
                 attachments.
        - Fixed: pm_save_attachment_id() causing problems when a PM
                 already has an attachment ID. It now checks the
                 database first same as post_save_attachment_id does.
        - Fixed: all final_uri queries now check to make sure the
                 string is longer than 0 chars.
        - Fixed: exploit in final_uri that allowed people to load
                 another website into the discussion frame of Beehive.
        - Fixed: grammar error in "You have 1 a new PM" language
                 string.
        - Fixed: PM's always showing as having attachments. Added a new
                 function to pm.inc.php called pm_has_attachments()
                 which will actually check the POST_ATTACHMENT_FILES
                 table for attachments same as the 
                 thread_has_attachments() does.
        - Fixed: user_get_aliases() no longer include empty IPAddress
                 matches in the check.
        - Fixed: moved USER_PREF modifications out of 0.5-to-0.6
                 upgrader foreach loop into main part of installer so
                 they are only performed once.
        - Fixed: undefined variable $db_post_save_attachment_id on line
                 722 of pm.inc.php
        - Fixed: logon drop down not working on expired session page.
        - Fixed: missing [1 new from thread list.
        - Fixed: Guest error login link loosing URL query due to it not
                 being encoded correctly.
        - Fixed: [x new of y] wrapping incorrectly by adding
                 white-space: nowrap to CSS
        - Fixed: "Ararar" error message in thread_options.php

                 broke the ?msg thing in email links.

        - Fixed: session failure page choking on $_POST being a
                 multi-dimensional array.
        - Fixed: threads_any_unread() not checking if the user had not
                 seen the thread before at all.
        - Fixed: bug with undefined index PATH_INFO in html.inc.php
        - Fixed: light mode always remembering password even when
                 tickbox unticked.
        - Fixed: logging in from light mode and then visiting the full
                 mode triggers showing the logon dialog even though
                 you've never visted it before.
        - Fixed: static webtag in poll.inc.php and upgrade-05-to-06.php
        - Fixed: undefined variable $lang in poll.inc.php
        - Fixed: Removed erranous space from end of constants.inc.php
                 that trips up if the output buffering is disabled.
        - Fixed: undefined variable $settings_array in forum.inc.php
        - Fixed: undefined $db_install in forum.inc.php
        - Fixed: removing a forum didn't remove the RSS_FEEDS and
                 RSS_HISTORY tables for that forum
        - Fixed: header_redirect problem when msie_buffer_fix() is
                 called producing output before headers
        - Fixed: undefined variable $chunks_array in format.inc.php
        - Fixed: undefined variable $chunks in format.inc.php

        - Changed: Simplified the calls to the email notification
                   functions requiring a msg and splitting it into
                   tid.pid when the function is called by joining
                   the tid & pid!
        - Changed: RSS feed now duplicates the headline in the quote
                   tag so if it gets truncated by Beehive's 64 char
                   limit on thread titles we still get to see it all.
        - Changed: All '{$table_data['FID']}' changed to $forum_fid
                   to make things neater and easier to understand.
        - Changed: Truncating of RSS thread title now works the same
                   as the search results.
        - Changed: Reformatted user_profile.php page so it should
                   display better.
        - Changed: Added error checking to installer/upgrade scripts.
        - Changed: Made the Find button on the Advanced Search form
                   auto-re-enable when the search results have
                   successfully loaded.
        - Changed: logon.php and logout.php to not use the expired
                   session page. Makes sense, no?
        - Changed: Removed <bdo> tags from thread_list.php
        - Changed: Added CDATA tags to the <title> element of the RSS
                   Feed which should help with FireFox not being able
                   to use the output.
        - Changed: Added an exclude_keys array list to 
                   form_input_hidden_array so you can specify named
                   keys to skip.
        - Changed: Added _array_chunk function which mimics 
                   PHP > 4.2.0's own function.
        - Changed: search indexing to ignore keywords with numerals
                   only (like: '000', '999', '911', '666' etc)
        - Changed: search indexing now chunks the keywords and
                   performs multiple queries in chunks of 20 keywords
                   in order to stop MySQL failing when the number of
                   words to index in one query is greater than the
                   highest extended query count.
        - Changed: Removed directory creation functionality from 
                   admin_default_forum_settings.php and added a 
                   function that is called by the script and all 
                   the other attachment scripts to check and create
                   the directory. The text captcha class already does
                   this.
        - Changed: Removed all the width and height attributes from
                   image tags to stop those images which are larger
                   or smaller from being resized by the browser.
        - Changed: Added optional UID argument to all the perm_*
                   functions that require it.
        - Changed: Added optional argument to disable ip address
                   logging as used by the RSS feed
        - Chamged: Added extra index to USER_POLL_VOTES (TID,
                   OPTION_ID) to improve poll performance
        - Changed: RSS Feed so it only fetches 10 feed items per update


What's new in 0.5 ("What You Have Is Enough", released 10th Dec 2004)
=================

- Notes
        - Beehive Forum 0.5 corrected a very large scale problem with
          stripslashes which means that content created with prior
          versions may be subject to erroneous display once you
          upgrade to 0.5.

- Brand new features

        - Multiple Forum support. Yes, finally you can run more than
          one forum on your web space using a single Beehive
          installation, under a 'My Forums' linking system.
        - Forums can be open/closed/restricted/passworded.
        - Install/upgrade script simplifies installation process.
        - Comprehensive user permissions - users can be given/denied access
          to post/read/moderate etc. in specific folders, as well as having 
          HTML/sig privileges given/denied.
        - As well as per-folder moderators, a user can be assigned as a 
          'Global moderator', who can moderate in all folders.
        - User groups can be created to help moderation of large forums.
        - New 'Forum Links' drop-down in the top frame allows for linking
          other Beehive forums and sites easily.
        - New 'My Controls' replaces the old preferences and profile
          sections, incorporating them into a single location.
        - Emoticons. Really fancy emoticons. With per-user options to
          display
          any of several graphical sets, or plain-text, or nothing at all.
        - Emoticon preview pane on post page for quick reference.
        - Users can now perform basic moderation duties on their own
          posts on the new 'Thread Options' page, including changing
          the thread title and moving the thread to different folders.
          Admins can prevent this functionality by 'edit locking' the
          thread to prevent it from being changed.
          - Users can access 'Thread Options' by clicking the icon to
the left
          of every thread title in the thread list frame. From here a thread
          can
          be ignored without ever reading it.
        - Posts can now be marked as unread, for later reading.
        - New 'Reply as PM' link on every post will quickly create a new PM
          addressed to the post author, with the thread title as the subject.
        - Number of PMs per user can be restricted by the admin.
        - PM auto-pruning - messages not in the 'saved' folder can be 
          automatically deleted after a certain time has passed.
        - Option to reply a PM with the in-reply-to PM's text quoted.
        - New user option to change all images embedded into a post by
          users (inc. signature images) into clickable links.
        - 'Reply to all' allows a user to reply to an entire thread instead of
          a specific post.
        - New tabular polls to compare votes from different poll groups.
        - Quick search.
        - Per-user word filter.
        - Beautifier (www.beautifier.org) integration with BH <code> tag.
        - <spoiler> tag to hide text which may otherwise spoil that movie
          you're planning on seeing tonight's killer plot twist. <spoiler>He
          was dead all along!!</spoiler>
        - <noemots> tag to prevent anything within it from being converted to
          an emoticon.
        - New post page preferences which allow you to toggle the HTML
          toolbar, the emoticons preview pane and the signature text
          field. You can also choose an HTML mode by default; you can
          choose to enable/disable emoticons in your messages by
          default and so on.
        - English Language Dictionary available from the HTML Toolbar
          which can be configured to auto-check spelling each time you
          post.
        - Guest account no longer requires cookies, so that search engines can
          spider Beehive forums. A robots.txt file is also included to help
          search engines spider the right content.
        - A user can now set their default start page to be the thread list in
          the left frame, and the forum start page in the right frame.
        - New thread_rss.php allows recent Beehive threads to be loaded into
          an RSS reader.
        - Previous/next post navigation arrows.
        - 'Unread Today' threadlist filter option.
        - Admin tools to delete all a user's posts in a thread, or throughout
          the whole forum.
        - Admin option to delete an entire thread.
        - 'Ignore Completely' option allows you to ignore all posts to/from a
          user as well as any threads they create.

- Enhanced old features

        - HTML toolbar is now present for post creation; post editing;
          poll creation; signature editing; PM creation; PM editing;
          start page editing. Can't get enough of that HTML toolbar.
        - Slicker HTML integration - <quote>/<code>/<spoiler> tags won't show
          their innards, for example.
        - Better editing page. No longer will you have to toggle between a 
          plain-text/HTML version of your post - BH will automatically 
          approximoguesstimate what settings you originally posted your
          message with.
        - Polls can now be 'soft-edited' - minor edits which won't reset the
          votes.
        - Poll options can either be displayed as radio buttons (as before) or
          as a drop-down list.
        - Improved word filter that allows you to find and replace
          rather than obscure the filtered words with asterix.
        - Word filter can now be disable without having to clear the
          filter list of the current entries. Useful if browsing from
          different places such as home and work.
        - Many pages have had their output tweaked so they fit in with
          the overall style of beehive.
        - Attachments now support the uploading of multiple files at
          the same time. Useful for dial-up users who want to attach
          multiple files without having to do each file in turn.
        - The forum owner can now choose to have deleted attachments
          still show (with the link removed) in posts.
        - Alternative attachment method which allows Beehive to make
          use of the old 0.3 and older attachment retrieval method for
          servers that can't handle the newer method.
        - The search page has been remade with a better design and
          better functionality.
        - 'Page [1] 2 3 ...' on various pages rewritten a bit posher.

- Fixes
        - Lots and lots!

- Known Issues

        - Content created prior to the installation of 0.5 will be
          incorrectly escaped (all ' and " characters will appear as 
          \'and \" respectively). This is due to a major bug in 
          versions prior to 0.5 which meant content inserted into
          the database was double-escaped.

          visiting the admin folders option and fixing the folder
          names. This was due to a bug in previous versions which has
          now been fixed.

What's new in 0.3.1 ("Beemused", released 3rd September 2003)
===================

- New features / Enhancements
        - There are no new features or enhancements in this release.
          This release is primarily intended to fix some problems that
          exist in MySQL 4.0.13 and higher. Don't worry 0.4 will be
          coming soon!

- Fixes
        - Users lost access to restricted folders if they ignored them
        - Queen could loose her 'Queen' Status and be demoted to a
          soldier if he/she changed her own permissions through the
          Admin Users interface.
        - It was not possible to delete Profile Items and when deleting
          a Profile Section the wrong one was deleted.
        - Threads would not be visible at all regardless of folder
          interest settings under MySQL 4.0.13 and later
        - Recent discussions list on Start Page would appear empty
          under MySQL 4.0.13.

What's new in 0.3 ("A little Beehind", released 11th February 2003)
=================

- Brand new features
        - All output is now optionally gzip encoded to save bandwidth.
        - The styles system has changed a bit - the majority of the
          stylesheet is now static, which saves even more bandwidth.
        - You can modify the start page directly from the admin
          interface.
        - As well as ignoring a user, you can make them your "Friend",
          and filter the thread list to only show discussions started
          by Friends if you want.
        - New poll system, with up to 20 options per poll.
        - There's a new frame-less light HTML "diet" version of the
          forum
        - now you can browse and post from a PDA and some mobile
          phones.
        - A links section that allows your users to create a database
          of useful links.
        - You can see a list of possible aliases for any user (people
          who have logged in from the same IP address before)
        - Banning a user by IP address is now possible.
        - Option to delete all of a user's posts in the admin
          interface.
        - You can now ignore entire folders.

- Enhanced old features
        - Guest access is now optional.
        - Other changes to polls, such as the ability to post an
          explanatory message at the same time as you post the poll.
        - Various new UI stuff - friend / attachment icons in the
          thread list, link back to the voting form in a poll thread.
        - Polls are now slightly more anonymous (at least, it's not
          trivial for someone with database access to see how you
          voted, but neither is it secure).
        - Users can choose to be directed straight to the forum
          (bypassing the start page) when logging in.
        - The time a user last logged on and the total number of posts
          they have made on the forum are displayed in their profile.
        - You can now ignore only someone's signature, or globally
          ignore all signatures if you want.
        - Mark as Read has more options (all discussions, visible
          discussions, next 50 discussions)

- Fixes
        - We've given the code a spring clean - hopefully there are now
          no PHP errors/warnings/notices at all.
        - Various fixes to make things work properly with
          Microsoft-IIS.
        - Some fixes to properly support PHP 4.3.x.
        - Some of the database stuff (mainly thread list queries) has
          been optimised for efficiency.
        - Database errors are now caught in a nice way.
        - Some session handling improvements

What's new in 0.2 ("Let It Bee", released 12th September 2002)
=================

- User Selectable Styles: Forum members can now select from a number of
  styles to change the appearance of the forum. Pretty much everything
  can be styled, by editing the CSS files and altering the images.

- Polls: Polls are now enabled. They let people vote, and stuff.

- Attachments: Forum owners can optionally enable the attachments
  feature, allowing members to upload files to the forum server.
  Space available per member can be limited.

- Forgot password: Muppets who forget their passwords can now get an
  e-mail to the address they entered, with a link where they can reset
  the password.

- Guest access: Casual browsers can access forums as guests, but can
  not post.

- Lots of little things: Little enhancements here and there that just
  generally make things nicer. Like friend icons in the message view,
  and multiple logins being saveable.

- Discontinued undocumented features: Most of the undocumented features
  from 0.1 have been removed, such as the undocumented feature where
  fix_html would occasionally loop until PHP timed out, and the famous
  "time-travelling" undocumented feature where post's creation times
  were updated when they were read by the user they were addressed to.

- New undocumented features: It is possible that the addition of the
  new documented features has resulted in the accidental addition of
  new undocumented features. If you believe you have found an
  undocumented feature, please let us know in the test forum at
  http://beehiveforum.net/forum

- \o/ Domain name \o/: We got the domain name registered, so you can
  now use http://beehiveforum.net for all your Beehive URL needs.
  It's still hosted on SourceForge (http://sf.net), lovely people that
  they are.
