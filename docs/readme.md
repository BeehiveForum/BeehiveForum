### 1. Installation

#### 1.1 Requirements

You need web hosting which provides:

- PHP 5.3.0 or above
- MySQL 5.1.41 or above
- PCRE 6.6 compiled with --enable-utf8 --enable-unicode-properties

##### 1.1.1 Requirements Notes

- Beehive Forum requires PHP 5.3.0 as a minimum. However, the Beehive
  Forum team highly recommend using the latest available PHP version
  available for your platform. Please note that as of 11th July 2013
  PHP 5.3 will only receive security updates and it is highly
  recommended that you upgrade to PHP 5.4 or 5.5.

- PCRE 6.6 compiled with --enable-utf8 --enable-unicode-properties
  is required. PCRE support is OS dependent, please check with your
  host for PCRE requirements.

- MySQL 5.1.41 or newer is required by Beehive Forum. As with PHP we
  recommend installing the latest release of MySQL 5 if possible.

- As a minimum Beehive Forum requires the following privileges on the
  MySQL database and tables it runs from:

    - SELECT,
    - CREATE,
    - CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES,
    - INSERT,
    - ALTER,
    - UPDATE,
    - INDEX,
    - DELETE,
    - DROP.

  You may optionally grant the FILE permission to speed up the
  creation of the dictionary during installation but Beehive Forum.
  Once installation has completed you may restore the default
  permissions without suffering any reduced functionality.

#### 1.2 Instructions

##### 1.2.1 Manual Installation

###### 1.2.1.1 Archive Extraction

How you extract the contents of the Beehive Forum distribution
archive is very important. At all times please ensure that you retain
the directory structure of the archive. If everything has been
extracted correctly you should be presented with a directory that
looks a bit like this:

        |- docs
        |  |- schema.sql
        |  |- upgrade-01-to-02.sql
        |  |- ...
        |
        |- forum
        |  |- attachments
        |  |  |- ...
        |  |
        |  |- ckeditor
        |  |  |- ...
        |  |  |
        |  |- emoticons
        |  |  |- default
        |  |  |  |- images
        |  |  |  |  |- alien.png
        |  |  |  |  |- ...
        |  |  |  |
        |  |  |  |- definitions.php
        |  |  |  |- desc.txt
        |  |  |  |- style.css
        |  |  |
        |  |  |- none
        |  |  |  |- desc.txt
        |  |  |  |- style.css
        |  |  |
        |  |  |- text
        |  |  |  |- desc.txt
        |  |  |
        |  |  |- README
        |  |
        |  |- include
        |  |  |- admin.inc.php
        |  |  |- attachments.inc.php
        |  |  |- ...
        |  |
        |  |- install
        |  |  |- config.inc.php
        |  |  |- index.php
        |  |  |- ...
        |  |
        |  |- js
        |  |  |- admin.js
        |  |  |- attachments.js
        |  |  |- ...
        |  |
        |  |- styles
        |  |  |- default
        |  |  |  |- images
        |  |  |  |  |- admin_tool.png
        |  |  |  |  |- attach.png
        |  |  |  |  |- ...
        |  |  |  |
        |  |  |  |- style.css
        |  |  |  |- top.html

As you can see the main distribution contains a docs and forum
folder. The main forum folder, which actually contains the
Beehive Forum files, itself contains several more folders with
relevant files in them. If they are not extracted into the right
place subsequently uploading them to your server will result in
your Beehive Forum not working.

###### 1.2.1.2 Database setup

There are several different ways you can create a database for your
Beehive Forum to live in. Some hosts will may provide an
administrative control panel such as CPanel or Plesk, others may
offer direct access to phpMyAdmin. If available you may also use a
program like SQLYog or even the MySQL CLI client.

Use which ever you're most comfortable with. All you need to remember
to do is to take note of the database name, and any applicable user
credentials, as you will need them when you come to run the Beehive
Forum installer.

Beehive Forum would prefer it if you could provide it with its very
own database, and separate user credentials to use, but if you can't
provide them it should work in an existing one so long as there are
no conflicting table names.

###### 1.2.1.3 MySQL permissions

To ensure full functionality as a minimum Beehive Forum requires the
following privileges granted on the user account it will use for
interacting with your MySQL database:

SELECT, CREATE, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, INSERT, ALTER,
UPDATE, INDEX, DELETE and DROP.

Additionally you can grant the FILE privilege globally for the user
account to aid in the creation of the dictionary. To do this will
also require GRANT permission on the database you are to install
Beehive to. Without the FILE privilege the installer for Beehive
Forum will still function but it will take a lot longer to complete.

###### 1.2.1.4 Upload

You should now upload the forum onto your web space. We recommend
that you simply upload the "forum" folder directly, either into the
root of your web space or into another folder of your choosing.

###### 1.2.1.5 Installing the forum

Once everything is uploaded, you will need to run the forum's install
script. This is located in the /install subdirectory of your forum.
To access it, you will need to load the file in your browser from
the web space you just uploaded to, e.g.:

http://www.mysite.com/forum/install/index.php

This will then walk you through the creation of your new forum. Note
that you will need your MySQL database's host address, username and
password for this stage, as well as the name of the database from
step 1.2.2.  You should be able to get the information from your
hosting provider if you're not running your own server.

##### 1.2.2 Installation with Softaculous

Beehive Forum can also be installed using Softaculous auto-install.
If your hosting supports Softaculous, please visit the Softaculous
Beehive Forum page here:

https://www.softaculous.com/apps/forums/Beehive

##### 1.3 Using your Beehive Forum

###### 1.3.1 First use

If all went well, you should now have a working forum! After deleting
the /install subdirectory (as is described by the install script) you
can then log in to your newly created administrator account, using
the details you specified at install. This account gives you access
to everything, so you can create folders, set user permissions and
so forth.

###### 1.3.2 Adminning

Now you're ready to create some folders, so click the admin link near
the top of the page, then choose folders from the menu on the left,
and set them up.

You may also wish to change the access permissions of your forum. In
the admin section you will find options for restricting access to
your Beehive Forum. The two main options are restricted, where each
user account needs to be given permission to access the forum and
password protected, where your forum uses a common password that can
be given to users to allow them access.

The other links on the left let you set up profile sections and
items, where your members can provide information about themselves if
they like, and do stuff to users, like ban them, gag them or promote
them. You can also edit the forum 'start' page, change the forum
style, add forum word filters and so forth. It's all explained in
there.

###### 1.3.3 What to do if it doesn't work

Don't panic. Pop over to <http://www.tehforum.co.uk/forum/> and ask us
for help, but remember, we don't get paid for this, so be nice.

It's helpful if you can tell us your setup when you've got a problem,
such as the type of server (e.g. Linux/Apache, Windows/Apache or
Windows/IIS, etc) and the version of PHP and MySQL that you're using.
If your Beehive Forum threw up an error message, paste that in as
well.

###### 1.3.4 Add your forum to our list (optional)

If you like, you can add your shiny new forum to our list of live
copies by going to <http://beehiveforum.co.uk/forums.php>

It could be a bit of publicity for your site, and it helps us to be
able to say "Look, all these people are using it!", but if you don't
want to, you don't have to.

###### 1.3.5 Enabling email notifications

By default Beehive Forum uses PHP's built-in mail function to send
email notifications to users. On *nix, PHP is set up to use sendmail.
In order to send email from your forum you will need to install
sendmail or a clone such as postfix. On Windows platforms PHP is set
up to send mail via SMTP to localhost only. If you are not running a
mail server on localhost you will need to edit php.ini and change
the SMTP setting in the [mail function] section. Additionally you
may also need to change the sendmail\_from setting if your ISP / host
requires emails to be sent from a specific address.

If your mail server requires SMTP authentication to send email you
will need to change the settings in Global Forum Settings under
Admin on your forum. Please note that Beehive does not support POP
before SMTP (sometimes called SMTP after POP). The settings you need
to enter will vary depending on your hosting provider or ISP. If you
do not know this information, you must ask for help from your host.
Unless the information is public knowledge, we cannot help you with
it.

More information on configuring the mail function can be found in
the PHP manual here: <http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mail.php>

#### 1.3 Customising your Beehive Forum

Beehive Forum has user-selectable styles. Basically these are like
themes (or skins for WinAmp users) for your forum. There are several
supplied styles, and it's easy to create your own.

You can edit the existing styles, but we recommend that you create
your own.

To create a new style simply create a new folder in the styles
folder, with the name of the new style. For example, to add a style
called "fish", you need a folder called "fish" in the "styles" folder.

Then copy in the contents of one of the existing folders to base your
new style on (the "default" folder is probably a good start) -
style.css, top.html and the images folder with contents.

##### 1.3.1 Start page

To edit the start page you can use the built-in start page editor.
This is located in Admin &gt; Start Page.

As of Beehive Forum 1.0 the start page is saved directly to the
database and no physical file is saved to the file system. To be able
to create more complicated start pages, such as those which include
PHP code, you will need to replace the saved information in the
database by hand using phpMyAdmin or SQLYog.

Prior to Beehive Forum 1.0, the start page was saved to the file
system in the forums subdirectory within another folder named to
match the webtag of the folder.

##### 1.3.2 Stylesheet

If you know how to write and edit CSS, you can edit the style.css
file in the /styles/[stylename] folder to change colours, fonts and
things like that.

We recommend taking a backup first, though, in case you make a mess
of it.

As of BeehiveForum 0.8 you can also create per-file style sheets that
allow you to give different pages different designs. This would for
example allow you to give the thread list a background image but
leave the other pages using the same design.

To do this all you would need to do is create a .css file with the
same name as the PHP script you want it to affect, sans it's
extension. i.e. for the thread list you would create a style sheet
named thread\_list.css and place it in the same folder as the main
style.css. Beehive will automatically find and use this style
sheet in preference to the main style.css.

Please note, prior to Beehive Forum 1.0, when Beehive encounters the
per-file style sheet it will exclude the main style.css so any
classes you want displayed in all your forum styles must be defined
in each of your per-page .css files. With the release of Beehive
Forum 1.0 this functionality has been changed to include the per-file
CSS file in addition to the main style.css and allows you to make use
of CSS precedence to defined when the CSS should be applied.

##### 1.3.3 Images

Feel free to edit the images in the /styles/[stylename]/images folder
too, as long as the dimensions remain the same. Again, you might want
to take backups.

##### 1.3.4 The top frame

The very top frame is yours to do with as you wish. In each style's
folder you will find a file called top.php, which you can edit any
way you like, put what you want in there, little Flash movies with
solar/lunar cycles or big headache inducing adverts for stuff, it's
entirely up to you. Just keep it 60 pixels high or under and it'll
fit in just fine.

##### 1.3.5 Emoticons

Beehive Forum uses CSS-styled emoticons. This allows the end-user to
have great control, being able to choose from options such as
completely invisible, text-only, and the range of graphic sets which
can be installed.

To create an emoticon pack first add a subdirectory (named whatever
you like - for example's sake I'll choose 'mypack') in the
/emoticons directory. In this directory create a file named
definitions.php. This file contains the textual pattern definitions
of the emoticons. For example, to add a ':-)' emoticon, one would
add the following line:

        $emoticon[':-)'] = "smile";

Once you have finished adding your pattern definitions you need to
create a file desc.txt (which contains one line describing your
pack, e.g. "My Pack") and a style.css file. To add your ':-)'
emoticon you will need CSS code similar to this:

        .e\_smile {
            padding-left: 15px; // the width of the image
            height: 13px;       // the height of the image
            font-size: 13px;    // the height of the image
            background-image: url("./images/smile.gif");
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
        }

        .e\_smile span {
            display: none;
        }

Notice the class name 'e\_smile' - this is the word you associated
with the ':-)' pattern in definitions.php ("smile") prefixed by
'e\_'. Be careful not to use the same associated word for different
emoticons (it's fine to use the same word for, for example, both
':)' and ':-)', however). Also note that every .e\_NAME class must
also have the .e\_NAME span { ... } class.

##### 1.3.6 GeSHi

Beehive Forum uses several 'custom' HTML tags, including the
&lt;code&gt; tag. This tag now accepts a 'language' attribute which
will highlight your code, thanks to the open-source software GeSHi
1.0.6 or later from <http://qbnz.com/highlighter/>

To include GeSHi syntax highlighting with your Beehive Forum
install simply download the latest version of GeSHi and upload
it to a subdirectory 'geshi' in your main forum folder. For example
if your forum was at www.site.com/forum/ you would upload GeSHi to
www.site.com/forum/geshi/.

To change any GeSHi settings edit the file include/geshi.inc.php.

Note: GeSHi is not created nor supported by the Beehive Forum
developers.

##### 1.3.7 WYSIWYG Editor

Since release 1.3.0, Beehive Forum uses CKEditor to provide it's
HTML WYSIWYG editor. This replaces the built-in HTML editor and
TinyMCE that was used in older releases.

CKEditor version 4.5.9 is included with Beehive Forum 1.5.2.
You DO NOT need to download and install any additional software
for it to work.

Note: Neither CKEditor nor TinyMCE are created by the Beehive
Forum developers. Although we will provide support while integrating
and using the software with your Beehive Forum, please note that
we are unable to fix bugs or help with the software generally.

#### 1.4 Upgrading from previous versions of Beehive Forum

If you're reading this you're looking for instructions on upgrading
your Beehive Forum to the latest and greatest available version.
Below you will find instructions pertaining to each individual
release. Please read them fully before starting the upgrade process.

As with all software installations or upgrades it is highly
recommended that you perform a backup of your existing web space
and database before upgrading your Beehive Forum. Failure to do
so could result in lost data. You have been warned. Don't make us
say we told you so.

##### 1.4.1 Upgrading your Beehive Forum installation

Beehive Forum's install script should be used to perform any upgrade
from 0.4 or newer. Previously .sql scripts were provided but due to
the nature of the software these are no longer viable.

###### 1.4.1.1 Make a back up of your database

You REALLY SHOULD make a back up of your database before you perform
the upgrade. We can't stress how important this is. If you don't
perform a backup and something goes wrong you'll be up shit creek
without a paddle and if things were to get even worse you may find
that you loose your boat as well.

The easiest way to perform a back up is by using ssh to connect
into your server and using mysqldump to 'dump' a copy of your
database to a file. Alternatively if you have access to the files
you could also take copies of the MySQL database files, although
this is only recommended for the more advanced user.

If you can do this then great, if not you might want to ask your
hosting provider if they can do it for you, at least temporarily
while you do the upgrade. Then if anything does go wrong you can
easily have the the data restored.

If your hosting provider is less than cooperative about doing this
then your next best chance of performing a backup is by using
phpMyAdmin and making use of it's Export facility to save a copy
of the database to your PC using your web browser. Be warned that
doing it this way will result in a rather large file being created
on your HDD so make sure you have adequate disc space in order to
do this. It is also be harder, due to the limitations of HTTP to
restore the backup using phpMyAdmin.

###### 1.4.1.2 Back up your files

The easiest way to back up your Beehive Forum files is to take a
copy of the forum directory and it's contents. Restoring this back
up incase of upgrade failure is then simply a case of uploading the
files and overwriting the changes.

###### 1.4.1.3 Upload new forum files

This step is similar to 1.2.4, but you will need to overwrite your
existing files with the newer ones provided in the Beehive Forum
archive you have downloaded.

Note: If you have made any customisations to your existing Beehive
Forum installation, including styles and emoticons packs and any
code modifications, you might wish to rename your existing forum
directory to something else so that you can easily compare the old
and news files in order to reapply any of the customisations you
want to keep.

If you do not have any customised styles, emoticon packs or code
modifications made to your existing Beehive Forum installation you
can simply overwrite all of the files with the new ones.

###### 1.4.1.4 Run the upgrade script

Once you've backed up your database/files and uploaded the new files,
you will need to run the upgrade script, located at install/index.php
in your forum directory:

http://www.mysite.com/forum/install/index.php

Make sure you select the correct 'Upgrade' proceedure from the
installation method drop-down list, and then follow the instructions.

##### 1.4.2 Skipping a version during upgrade

Skipping versions during upgrade is unsupported by the Beehive Forum
development team. To upgrade from 0.5 to 0.7 (for example) you should
first download and upgrade to 0.6 and then upgrade separatly to 0.7.
We appreciate that this is long winded and highly inconvienient but
it is the only reliable method of upgrading and you should really
only have to do it once.

##### 1.4.3 Upgrading from 0.5PR1 to 0.5

0.5PR1 is no longer supported by the development team. If you are
still running this version of Beehive Forum please upgrade to 0.5
or a later release.

##### 1.4.4 Upgrading from 0.3 to 0.4

If you are already using 0.3 of Beehive Forum, you will need to
update your database. You should first backup by following the
steps in 1.4.1.

###### 1.4.4.1 Update the database

Simply run the /docs/update-03-to-04.sql script against the database
using phpMyAdmin or MySQL directly.

###### 1.4.4.2 Update the config file

Probably the easiest way to do this is to edit the config.inc.php
in the 0.4 download and set the relevant variables again.

##### 1.4.5 Upgrading from 0.2 to 0.3

Follow the procedures as detailed in steps 1.4.4 but when upgrading
the database as in step 1.4.4.1 use the /docs/update-02-to-03.sql
script instead of update-03-to-04.sql.

##### 1.4.6 Upgrading from 0.1 / 0.1.1 to 0.2

Follow the procedure as detailed in steps 1.4.4 but when upgrading
the database as in step 1.4.4.1 use the /docs/update-01-to-02.sql
script instead of update-03-to-04.sql.

##### 1.4.7 Upgrading from 0.1 or 0.2 to 0.4 and newer

No direct route exists for 0.1 or 0.2 to be upgraded to versions of
Beehive newer than 0.3. To upgrade either of these versions to the
latest release you will first need to run the relevant .sql script
files in order and then proceed to use the built in installer script.

For example if you are using Beehive Forum 0.1 you will need to run:

upgrade-01-to-02.sql followed by..
upgrade-02-to-03.sql followed by..
upgrade-03-to-04.sql.

This will bring the database up to 0.4 compatibility, and from there
you can use the upgrade script built into the newer releases of
Beehive to bring you bang up to date.

##### 1.5 Beehive Forum Error Reporter

Beehive Forum includes a comprehensive error reporter which can be
used to help diagnose faults and find bugs in the software. This
error reporter is indispensable in helping to develop the project
and should be used at all times when reporting problems you have
with the software.

In older releases the error reporter was enabled by default and
set to output error messages to all users but with the release of
Beehive Forum 0.8 it was decided the error reporter should at least
be partially silenced and the error reports instead sent to the
system error log (Apache error\_log or similar). This was primarily
done to reduce the security risk associated with potentially
sensitive data being released to end users.

Because not everyone has access to their server's error log
(shared hosting, etc.) we have also implement error reporting by
email. With this option you can continue to receive detailed error
messages from your Beehive Forum installation with none of the
associated risks. It also means you can continue to report bugs
back to the development team and get help diagnosing faults.

Due to the nature of the Beehive Forum the error reporter can
only be enabled automatically if you're performing a new
installation. To do this you simply tick the relevant box under
Advanced Options in the installer. The changes will be
automatically made to your config.inc.php for you and you are
then good to go.

To enable the error reporter for upgrades please follow the
instructions below.

##### 1.5.1 Enabling Error Reporter after upgrading

This process applies to Beehive Forum 0.8 and newer only. Please
note that older versions of the software already have the error
reporter enabled by default.

To enable error reporting after upgrading you will need to
manually edit the config.inc.php file generated during the
installation process of your Beehive Forum. You will find this file
within the include folder on your web space. Please do not use the
config.inc.php file from the distribution archive. This is a
template file used by the installer and will not work without
further changes.

To begin, download the config.inc.php using FTP and save it
somewhere on your PC. As good place as any is your desktop. Once
you have it downloaded make a copy of the file just in case
something goes wrong and then open it using a text editor.
Windows users are recommended to use Notepad. Please do not use
Microsoft Wordpad or Microsoft Word, or any other word processor
for that matter, unless you know what you're doing, as these may
cause problems with the format of the file. *nux users, we're sure
you'll do just fine with vi or vim or even gedit.

To actually enable the error handler you need to change two
variables. The first variable to be changed is named
$error\_report\_verbose and should be changed from false to true.
Second is the $error\_report\_email\_addr\_to variable. This is
where you should enter your email address. Once changed the
variables should look a bit like this:

        $error\_report\_verbose = true;
        $error\_report\_email\_addr\_to = 'youremail@address.com';

Once you've made the changes save the file. If given the choice save
the file as UTF-8 encoded with PC / Windows line endings. This will
make the file more portable and easier to edit later.

Finally upload the modified config.inc.php making sure to replace
the existing copy and check that your Beehive Forum continues to
function. If it does, sit back and wait to see if you receive any
error reports. If you don't it's quite possible you're not actually
getting any errors which is a good thing, but if you suspect you
should be check that the email address is correct.

If you can't get the error reporting to function or if you break
your Beehive Forum you can simply restore the copy of config.inc.php
you made earlier or try again. If you continue to have problems
please seek assistance at Teh Forum, a link for which you find below
in the Support section.

### 3.3 Beehive Forums in foreign languages

Since the release of Beehive Forum 0.4 multiple languages have been
supported, but because we're all very busy doing other things the
number of languages that actually ship with Beehive Forum are few
and far between. We hope to rectify this over time, but in order
to do so we require volunteers. If you would like to help translate
Beehive Forum into your native tongue please see below.

#### 3.3.1 Translating Beehive Forums into my native language

Unfortunately the Beehive Forum coding team consists primarily of
born and bred English men who have enough trouble speaking our own
tongue as it is. Because of this, we're on the look out for people
to start translating Beehive Forum for us. If you feel you have the
necessary skills to do this (no babelfish / direct from dictionary
translations please) feel free to drop us a note. With any luck your
language file may end up being distributed with future versions of
Beehive Forums and you may even get to see your name in print, or
at the very least bundled here amongst the other credits.

#### 3.3.2 Completed Translations

Current complete translations are as follows:

English British.

#### 3.3.3 Incomplete / Partial Translations

None currently.
